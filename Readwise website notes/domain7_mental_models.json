Perseverance knowing this project could take 7-10 years and even though no one wanted to commit that there was enough cognitive dissonance to believe it was different this time The inside view prevents you from seeing the unknown unknowns that throw a wrench in plans people only see what is in front of them and extrapolate even if what has been done so far isn't indicative of the future of the project If the data is reliable the outside view is the base rate and the inside view is the intuition about the specific situation. Find a good reference class for the problem find useful statistics in that reference class then use specifics of the case to adjust from there The planning fallacy leads to over optimistic guesses that do not weigh the risks properly because hey understate and don't fully understand the risks",

It should have in some way uncapped upside such that if you do it, there's a chance of a lottery outcome, whatever you decide that lottery outcome is, but it's some kind of exponential upside. And the downside worst case is that you build a skill that then you could reapply elsewhere. And so I look at writing on Twitter as the perfect example of this. The upside is every single time you publish a tweet, it could go viral. Anyone on the world could see it, Elon Musk could see it, you could reach the most powerful people in the world. So if you publish 100 tweets, 200, 500, 1000, you're putting all those lottery tickets on goal, or in your pocket, worst case, you write 100 tweets for 100 days and you become a little bit better of a writer and no one reads them at all. And so I think for anyone thinking of how am I, what am I leveling up on right now? Make sure you're playing a game that has both exponential upside and zero downside because you would build a skill that then you could reapply later.",

        "text": "To think clearly about the future we need to clean up our thoughts on the past. We can't know what going to happen only have some idea because the future is unknown so nothing can be known about it we have to do the best we can with what we have. We do have incredible hindsight bias in outcomes. Tough to know the unknowable and it's more clear in hindsight. People think they thought something different in the past based on how the future turned out they change their past beliefs. Outcome bias makes it hard to understand beliefs when the decision was made. Hindsight is unkind with people who act for agents for others. The worse the outcome the greater the hindsight bias. We think we know more in the moment then we actually do. Tough to understand skill vs luck in a situation that is rare and a few lucky outcomes in big situations can lead to skill being overrated for that person",

I think the consensus we got to was every year, there's probably maybe three decisions that are actually important that you do to bake. The problem is you don't really know what those three are beforehand, but in retrospect, it generally is obvious. And I think maybe it's where to analogy, but I think in life, it's also similar to in life, you make a lot of decisions about do you have ice cream today or not, for example, but probably that doesn't matter that much. Probably the path I got all of us here comes down to probably five or 10 decisions you made in your life. And so I think preparing yourself for those maybe three important decisions is important.",
