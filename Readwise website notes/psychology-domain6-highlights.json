You can be super focused on reading but not see the gorilla on the screen. Mental effort is also finite and runs out when you are using it more the less you see around you. You only have x amount of attention so even if you're 100% focused you can't have materially more attention than your max capable attention. The more skilled or talented you are at something the less attention you need to devote to it to perform at a similar level to someone with less of the two. System one can deal with simple integrations but system 2 deals with integrating complex topics Intelligence is the control of attention and efficiency in performing tasks. Time pressure adds to fast thinking and causes more effortful thinking We solve by easy steps and work by the law of least effort",
