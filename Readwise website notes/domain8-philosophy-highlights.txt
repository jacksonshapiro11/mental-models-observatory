How can we acquire it? then we need to understand reason, truth, and meaning which gets to logic and perception mind and consciousness.

Takes a big negative point in our lives, to ask questions and think ourselves there's no reason we can't do it without that negative experience. Socratic question what sort of person should I be/ values I should aim for. Virtues courage wisdom temperance and justice. There are more questions than answers in philosophy we must create the answers for ourselves. Happiness traditional was seen as a life situation not a passing feeling. Happiness was a good content life. Time is elastic while it's finite when we do things we like time slows down and molds around us while in a rote repetition doing the same thing every day we can say we've lived a lifetime but also only 1 day.",

At the high rung there is complexity and messiness in which we debate structure and steel man our side creating and honest market for ideas on the low end we're just running around with our hair on fire calling things good and bad. People like a political Disney world because their views are easy to digest and clear basically a hack on what to believe without thinking."
