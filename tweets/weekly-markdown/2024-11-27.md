SUB TWEET 1
Video call with your friend in Tokyo. You're laughing at something they said five seconds ago.

They're already responding to something else.

Relativity & Space-Time.

There's no universal "now." Each observer experiences their own present moment depending on location and speed.

SUB TWEET 2
From Reality Is Not What It Seems by Carlo Rovelli:

"There is past and future, but the present exists only locally. What is 'now' on Earth happened 15 minutes ago on Mars."

The delay isn't a technical glitch. It's physics.

SUB TWEET 3
I read a lot. Wanted to remember what mattered. Built this to help me think clearer. Maybe it helps you.

Your GPS tells you to turn left.

It knows where you are within feet. Would be miles off without accounting for satellites experiencing time differently than you.

Relativity & Space-Time.

Time runs at different speeds depending on gravity and velocity. Not the same everywhere

SUB TWEET 2
From The Frontiers of Knowledge by A. C. Grayling:

"The laws of physics stay constant, but the speed of light is absolute. Time moves differently for different observers."

GPS satellites literally age faster than you do.

Your watch shows 3pm. Your friend's watch across town shows 3pm.

An astronaut's clock on the space station shows something slightly different. Not broken. Actually different.

Relativity & Space-Time.

Each person has their own measure of time based on location and motion

SUB TWEET 2
From A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking:

"There is no unique absolute time. Each person has their own measure of time depending on where they are and how they're moving."

Your clock isn't everyone's clock.

SUB TWEET 3
Information overload is real. Spent time filtering what I read. See if any of it resonates.

## PROMPT 2: Variation, Selection, and Heredity

**Tweet 1:**

```
SUB TWEET 1
100 people apply for one job opening. The person who gets it had something the others didn't.

Next opening, same thing. Pattern repeats.

Variation, Selection, and Heredity.

Competition constantly filters for advantages. Those advantages compound over generations.

SUB TWEET 2
From #342 the Lessons of History by Founders:

"Competition is the first law of biology. Selection is constant, and it drives inequality that grows with the complexity of civilization."

Markets don't care about fairness. They select what works.

SUB TWEET 3
We all keep re-learning the same things. I organized them here. Take what's useful.

SUB TWEET 1
One company dominates the market for years. Looks invincible.

Then something kills it. Makes room for others to grow.

Variation, Selection, and Heredity.

Dominant players get culled to maintain diversity. No monopoly lasts forever when selection pressure continues.

SUB TWEET 2
From Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows:

"The spruce budworm kills dominant trees to maintain diversity. No single species can monopolize resources forever."

Monopolies are temporary. Selection keeps working.

Coasted through college. Everything came easy. Felt brilliant.

First real job kicks your ass. Suddenly you're learning fast.

Variation, Selection, and Heredity.

Difficult conditions teach lasting lessons because survival demands learning. Easy times breed overconfidence.

SUB TWEET 2
From The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks:

"Tough times teach valuable lessons that stick. Good times teach only bad lessons. They make success feel easy without the corrective pressure."

The lessons that hurt are the ones that last.

SUB TWEET 3
Hard to know what actually matters. I'm trying to figure it out. Maybe you are too.

## PROMPT 3: Kahneman's 8 Decision-Making Questions

**Tweet 1:**

```
SUB TWEET 1
New job offer. Better pay, different city, means uprooting your whole life.

You have to accept or decline by Friday.

Kahneman's 8 Decision-Making Questions.

A systematic framework forces conscious analysis of high-stakes decisions instead of trusting autopilot.

SUB TWEET 2
From Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman:

"Ask yourself: Is this a decision I should think fast or slow about? Am I too stressed to decide well? What would change my mind?"

Some decisions deserve the full framework. This is one.

SUB TWEET 3
Good ideas get buried fast. I pulled them together here. See what clicks.

About to propose. Can't undo it once you ask.

Choosing a restaurant for dinner. Easy to try somewhere else next time.

Kahneman's 8 Decision-Making Questions.

Irreversible decisions need slow, careful thinking. Reversible ones can move fast without much risk.

SUB TWEET 2
From Super Thinking by Gabriel Weinberg, Lauren McCann:

"Bezos asks: Is this a one-way door or a two-way door? Irreversible decisions need slow thinking. Reversible ones can move fast."

Know which type of decision you're making.

Inbox full. 50 decisions to make before lunch.

Treat them all the same and you'll burn out on things that don't matter.

Kahneman's 8 Decision-Making Questions.

Categorizing decisions by stakes and reversibility helps you allocate mental energy where it actually counts.

SUB TWEET 2
From The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish:

"Exceptional decision makers know which choices are one-way doors and optimize accordingly. They move fast on the reversible stuff."

Save your energy for what matters.

SUB TWEET 3
Core ideas buried in endless repackaging. Tried to get back to the core. Take what fits.

## PROMPT 4: Cognitive Biases & Systematic Errors

**Tweet 1:**

```
SUB TWEET 1
Plane crash on the news. Suddenly flying feels terrifying.

You drive to the airport instead. Statistically way more dangerous.

Cognitive Biases & Systematic Errors.

Vivid, dramatic events feel common even when they're rare. Your brain confuses memorable with probable.

SUB TWEET 2
From Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman:

"Availability bias makes dramatic events feel common. Media coverage of rare incidents distorts your sense of actual risk."

The vivid example drowns out boring statistics.

SUB TWEET 3
Started keeping notes for myself. Organized them into this. Explore if you want.

Friend recommends a restaurant. You Google it.

Read five reviews. Three are great, two are terrible. You focus on the two bad ones.

Cognitive Biases & Systematic Errors.

Information that's recent or emotionally charged weighs heavier in your mind than objective reality.

SUB TWEET 2
From Super Thinking by Gabriel Weinberg, Lauren McCann:

"Availability bias weights information by how easily it comes to mind. Recent or emotional events loom larger than objective reality."

What's fresh in your memory feels more true.

Your social media feed shows everyone agreeing with your political views.

Feels like everyone thinks like you. They don't.

Cognitive Biases & Systematic Errors.

Personalized algorithms create echo chambers that reinforce what you already believe and hide everything else.

SUB TWEET 2
From Super Thinking by Gabriel Weinberg, Lauren McCann:

"Personalized algorithms create filter bubbles that amplify availability bias. You see what confirms your beliefs, miss everything else."

Your feed isn't reality. It's a curated bubble.

Western doctor looks at herbs and sees superstition.

Traditional healer sees medicine.

Bias Inherent in Models & Hidden Assumptions.

You perceive through mental models that shape what you see

SUB TWEET 2
From The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch:

"All experience is guided through theories and models that contain inherent human bias. You perceive your models of reality, not reality itself."

The model determines what registers as real.

SUB TWEET 1
You learned economics assumes rational actors. Built your whole investment strategy on it.

People aren't rational. Your model was wrong from the start.

Bias Inherent in Models & Hidden Assumptions.

If your foundational assumptions are wrong, everything built on them is suspect

SUB TWEET 2
From The Frontiers of Knowledge by A. C. Grayling:

"There are twelve systematic biases that cause ignorance. Question the primitives. If your foundational assumptions are wrong, everything built on them fails."

Bad foundations doom the whole structure.

Scholar shows a book to an Amazon tribesman who's never seen writing.

Same object. Completely different perceptions.

Bias Inherent in Models & Hidden Assumptions.

What you know determines what you perceive. Perception requires mental models

SUB TWEET 2
From All Life Is Problem Solving by Karl Popper:

"Knowledge creates perception rather than the reverse. What you know shapes what you see. The neural patterns don't activate without the right models."

You see through your frameworks, not around them.

## PROMPT 6: Information Theory & Physical Reality

**Tweet 1:**

```
SUB TWEET 1
Text your partner "we need to talk." They know exactly what that means.

Four words. Massive information because it eliminates infinite possibilities

Information Theory & Physical Reality.

Information isn't measured by length. It's measured by how many alternatives it rules out

SUB TWEET 2
From Reality Is Not What It Seems by Carlo Rovelli:

"Information is measured by the number of alternatives it eliminates. The world isn't colliding atoms. It's correlations between physical systems."

Surprise carries more information than predictability.

SUB TWEET 3

SUB TWEET 1
Someone asks "Will you marry me?" Three words change everything.

Compare that to a 50-page contract you expected. More words, less information.

Information Theory & Physical Reality.

Information resolves uncertainty. The less expected, the more information it contains

SUB TWEET 2
From The Idea Factory by John Gertner:

"Shannon showed information resolves uncertainty. The less the recipient knows what comes next, the more information is revealed when it arrives."

Information is measured by surprise, not volume.

Meeting generates 200 PowerPoint slides. Everyone nods along.

Nothing surprising. Nothing decided. High bandwidth, zero signal.

Information Theory & Physical Reality.

Channel capacity sets an upper limit, but actual content often falls far short of what's possible.

SUB TWEET 2
From The Idea Factory by John Gertner:

"Information capacity sets an upper bound, but actual content often falls short. Signal versus noise matters more than volume."

Slides don't equal information.

## PROMPT 7: Model Testing & Refinement Through Criticism

**Tweet 1:**

```
SUB TWEET 1
You're convinced your startup idea will work. List all the reasons why.

Never write down reasons it might fail.

Model Testing & Refinement Through Criticism.

Mental models only improve when you expose them to systematic criticism and testing.

SUB TWEET 2
From Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows:

"Practice exposing your mental models to light. Make them explicit so they can be examined and improved through systematic criticism."

Hidden assumptions stay wrong forever.

SUB TWEET 3

SUB TWEET 1
Friend disagrees with your political view. You find ten articles proving you're right.

Never read one that challenges it.

Model Testing & Refinement Through Criticism.

Seeking confirmation is easy. Seeking to disprove what you believe is what actually teaches you.

SUB TWEET 2
From Conjectures and Refutations by Karl Popper:

"Seek to criticize and falsify beliefs rather than confirm them. The scientific method means trying to disprove what you think is true."

Confirmation is comfortable. Falsification is useful.

SUB TWEET 3

Big decision coming up. Wrote out your reasoning. Looks airtight.

But you never asked: "What would prove me wrong?"

Model Testing & Refinement Through Criticism.

The scientific method applies everywhere. Make bold conjectures, then ruthlessly try to disprove them.

SUB TWEET 2
From All Life Is Problem Solving by Karl Popper:

"Science is conscious application of critical method. Make bold conjectures, then ruthlessly seek to disprove them through observation."

Your best thinking needs your toughest criticism.
