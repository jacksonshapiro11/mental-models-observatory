# Decision Framework: What to Build and When
## Answer These Questions Before Building Anything

---

## 🎯 Core Questions

### 1. What's Your Unique Value Proposition?

**Question**: Why should someone follow you instead of Farnam Street, Shane Parrish, or other mental models content?

**Think about**:
- What's your unique angle?
- What do you bring that others don't?
- What's your differentiated viewpoint?

**Example answers**:
- "I connect models across disciplines in ways others don't"
- "I focus on practical application, not just theory"
- "I extract models from books with a unique synthesis"
- "I show how models combine for better outcomes"

**Action**: Write this down. It should guide everything.

### 2. Who Is Your Ideal Reader?

**Question**: Who are you writing for? Be specific.

**Think about**:
- What's their job/role?
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- What do they already know?
- What do they need?

**Example personas**:
- "Knowledge workers (30-45) who make complex decisions daily"
- "Entrepreneurs who need better frameworks for strategy"
- "Lifelong learners who read a lot but want synthesis"

**Action**: Pick one primary persona. Write for them.

---

### 3. What's Your Content Sequence?

**Question**: What should exist before what?

**The sequence matters because**:
- Newsletter needs website content to link to
- Reddit needs content to discuss
- Writing needs audience to read it
- Community needs reason to exist

**Suggested order**:
1. Website (quality foundation) ✅
2. Twitter (reach)
3. Newsletter (capture)
4. Your writing (differentiate)
5. Reddit (community)

**Action**: Decide your sequence. Don't skip steps.

---

### 4. Newsletter: What Makes It Different?

**Question**: Why would someone subscribe to your newsletter over others?

**Think about**:
- Format: Weekly? Bi-weekly? Monthly?
- Content: Models only? Book insights? Both?
- Voice: Academic? Practical? Personal?
- Length: Short? Medium? Long?

**Your idea**: "Model of the week + book insight with differentiated viewpoint"

**Refine this**:
- Which model? (Rotate through all 119? Focus on popular ones?)
- Which book? (Latest from Readwise? Most relevant?)
- What's the "differentiated viewpoint"? (Your synthesis? Connections? Applications?)

**Action**: Write 3 sample newsletter issues. See if they're different enough.

---

### 5. Writing: What's Your Voice?

**Question**: How do you write? What's your style?

**Think about**:
- Tone: Formal? Conversational? Academic?
- Structure: How do you organize ideas?
- Examples: Real-world? Hypothetical? Personal?
- Length: Short? Medium? Long-form?

**Your idea**: Book reviews extracting models with unique synthesis

**Refine this**:
- How is your review different from others?
- What's your process? (Read → Extract models → Synthesize → Apply?)
- How do you show your unique perspective?

**Action**: Write one article. Does it sound like you? Is it different?

---

### 6. Reddit: Join or Create?

**Question**: Should you create r/mentalmodels or join existing communities?

**Think about**:
- Existing communities: r/productivity, r/startups, r/books, r/getdisciplined
- Do they already discuss mental models?
- Would a dedicated subreddit add value?
- Do you have audience to seed it?

**Considerations**:
- **Join existing**: Easier, built-in audience, but less control
- **Create new**: More control, but need to build from scratch

**Action**: Spend a week engaging on existing subreddits. See if a new one is needed.

---

### 7. Community: What Problem Does It Solve?

**Question**: Why would people join your community?

**Think about**:
- What can they do there they can't elsewhere?
- What's the value of discussion vs. just reading?
- What makes it worth their time?

**Possible answers**:
- "Get help applying models to specific situations"
- "See how others use models in real life"
- "Discuss model combinations and connections"
- "Share book recommendations and insights"

**Action**: If you can't clearly articulate the value, don't build it yet.

---

### 8. Timing: What Needs to Exist First?

**Question**: What's the minimum viable ecosystem?

**Think about**:
- What can you do alone? (Writing, newsletter)
- What needs audience? (Reddit, community)
- What feeds what? (Twitter → Website → Newsletter → Community)

**Minimum viable**:
1. Website ✅
2. Twitter (automated)
3. Newsletter (weekly)
4. Your writing (weekly article)

**Then add**:
5. Reddit engagement
6. Reddit forum (if needed)
7. Community features

**Action**: Don't build community until you have content and audience.

## 🎯 Decision Matrix

### For Each Potential Build, Ask:

| Question | Answer | Build? |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Does it solve a real problem? | Yes/No | Only if Yes |
| Do I have audience for it? | Yes/No | Only if Yes |
| Does it differentiate me? | Yes/No | Only if Yes |
| Can I maintain it? | Yes/No | Only if Yes |
| Does it feed other parts? | Yes/No | Nice if Yes |

**Example: Reddit Forum**

| Question | Answer | Build? |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Does it solve a real problem? | Yes - people want to discuss | ✅ |
| Do I have audience for it? | Maybe - need to check | ⚠️ Wait |
| Does it differentiate me? | Yes - dedicated space | ✅ |
| Can I maintain it? | Yes - Reddit is low maintenance | ✅ |
| Does it feed other parts? | Yes - drives newsletter, writing | ✅ |

**Decision**: Wait until you have audience, then build.

## 🎬 What to Build First: The Decision

Based on your goals, here's the recommended sequence:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now - Month 1)
**Build**:
1. ✅ Website (done)
2. ✅ Twitter automation (done)
3. Newsletter (set up, first issue)
4. Your first article (book review)

**Why**: These are independent, low-risk, high-value.

### Phase 2: Content (Month 2-3)
**Build**:
5. Newsletter cadence (weekly, consistent)
6. Article library (10+ articles)
7. Reddit presence (engage, don't create yet)

**Why**: Build content and audience before community.

### Phase 3: Community (Month 4+)
**Build**:
8. Reddit forum (if audience ready)
9. Community features (if needed)

**Why**: Community needs content and people to discuss.

---

## 💭 Key Insight

**Don't build community until you have:**
1. Content worth discussing
2. Audience to discuss it
3. Time to moderate/engage
4. Clear value proposition

**Your writing and newsletter come first. They're your differentiators.**

Community amplifies what exists. It doesn't create it.

## ✅ Final Decision Framework

**Before building anything, write down**:

1. **What**: What exactly are you building?
2. **Why**: Why does it need to exist?
3. **Who**: Who is it for?
4. **When**: When is the right time?
5. **How**: How will you maintain it?

**If you can't answer all 5 clearly, don't build it yet.**

*Use this framework for every decision. It will save you time and keep you focused.*
