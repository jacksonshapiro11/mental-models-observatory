### Competitive Advantage & Sustainable Moats

**Model ID:** `business-strategy-competition-23a`  
**Slug:** `competitive-advantage-sustainable-moats`  
**Highlights:** 10

#### Description

Building defensible market positions through proprietary technology, network effects, brands, and scale advantages that compound over time

#### Curated Highlights

##### 1. Zero to One

**Readwise ID:** 518574749  
**Author:** Peter Thiel  
**Relevance:** 9.8/10  
**Quality:** 9.5/10  
**Type:** foundational_concept  

**Note:** Definitive framework for building monopolies: proprietary technology (10x better), network effects, economies of scale, and branding

> Power Law returns drive returns - The importance of power laws in VC most of the returns will come from a small subset of companies so you can only invest in companies that can return at minimum the value of the fund. Once you think that you’re playing the lottery you lose. Power laws only become clear overtime are tough to see in the moment. Because the best returns come from power laws you can’t diversify you need to concentrate. Make future decision based on your skills and where you can gain the most leverage ie don’t start a company but join a small company focus on strong concentrated areas of growth
What secrets do you know about the world that nobody else does? - Certain secrets are unseen to the public and are left to be discovered. Ted kazinski thought there were no hard problems left and nothing to be discovered. We’re taught to learn incrementally ie taught to tests ect and not be be explorers and learn more than needed because there is nothing left to be discovered. But there is always a new frontier when you push hard enough. Take unorthodox ideas seriously don’t believe everything has been discovered and believe in yourself. If you think something hard is impossible you’ll never even try to achieve it. Secrets can be about nature or people

**Author:** Charlie Munger  
**Relevance:** 9.6/10  
**Quality:** 9.3/10  
**Type:** practical_application  

**Note:** Explains different business models and their economics, showing how understanding competitive dynamics creates sustainable advantages

> Benefits of scale in business don’t go to airlines but do go to cereals and by is that. Probably because branding trumps commodity and commands more value. Investing in commodities leads to long term death because and capex doesn’t go to you but the consumer so it’s just competition to the bottom but no projection uses this second level thinking. Ride the waves of technology and stick into your circle of competence. You can’t know everything about everything so you need to bet big when you see a clear advantage otherwise stay reasonably market is generally efficient. Investment management is confusing because incentives are backwards. Best businesses are incentive allignment fedex paid not by the hour but by the shift and problems went away. Bet on high quality businesses and concentrate. Holding for 30 years vs selling short term has a 2.5% compounded effect on returns. Find great business small or large and hold forever. Envy drives the world. Paramutual race track view of markets. Spend each day trying to get a little wiser than you woke up. Constant compounding live with humor have low expectations and surround yourself with love from others. Live with change.

##### 3. #365 Nick Sleep's Letters

**Readwise ID:** 786822772  
**Author:** Founders  
**Relevance:** 9.4/10  
**Quality:** 9.1/10  
**Type:** practical_application  

**Note:** Demonstrates how focus and concentration on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages multiply returns over time

> Focus Multiplies Returns

Summary:
Prioritize focusing on the most significant insights or ideas, as they should dominate your efforts due to their transformative potential.

Dividing attention across multiple tasks decreases overall productivity, yielding diminishing returns. An additional hour devoted to a single project offers greater benefits than spreading efforts thinly across many.

Therefore, evaluate the opportunity costs of pursuing new endeavors against existing commitments, recognizing that only highly valuable new areas warrant the diversion of focus.

Concentrated effort in a few domains can lead to substantial success, as demonstrated by examples like investing heavily in a single stock.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
So the first thing is keep the thing the importance of keeping the main thing the main thing the importance of focusing and concentrating. And that is related to part two, which is one of my favorite ideas when they knew that they had uncovered a deep truth. And Nick says, if it's the single best thought you have ever had in your life, it needs to dominate everything, because you're not going to get many insights like that. And if it's your single best insight, your single best idea, then obviously it's what you're spending all your time on. There is a post written by one of the co-founders of Palantir. It talks about what he learned from working with Peter Thiel. And this part of the post I have saved on my phone, and I think it applies to exactly what's taking place here. Do not divide your attention. Focusing on one thing yields increasing returns for each unit of effort. At a micro level, an extra hour of focus on the current project has a much higher return than an hour on something new, or worse, five minutes each on 12 new things. Before you ever do something new, you should understand the opportunity cost versus existing things. Don't rationalize that something you want to do is complementary when it's not. At a macro level, understanding that applied effort has a convex output curve is a very useful discipline when considering new market areas. This convexity means that the opportunity cost of transferring resources from existing projects to new ones is high. Unless the new area is incredibly valuable, anything we can do to extend an existing convex curve is worth so much more. And so towards the end of the partnership, they're known for their heavy concentration in just three things. And like you and I talked about last week, in one case, 70% of their net worth, I think this was Zach's net worth, 70% of Zach's net worth was in Amazon, just one stock.

##### 6. #380 Four Hundred Pages of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger in Their Own Words

**Readwise ID:** 857640779  
**Author:** Founders  
**Relevance:** 9.1/10  
**Quality:** 8.7/10  
**Type:** practical_application  

**Note:** Shows how curiosity and systems perspective create unique differentiation and sustainable competitive advantages in investing

> Create your own luck by following your curiosity and intense interest. If you enjoy your work, you'll likely get better results and this will be magnified. If you don’t love it someone will work 10x harder and crush you. Importance of good role models. Envy runs the world. You can learn a lot by just monitoring an industry. Warren and Charlie saw google through gieco. Understood the value of the ads. Also looking for so many companies gave them the perspective on what was good and bad. The world is unfocused in short term so success requires you being the opposite. Partner with fanatics. There’s opportunity hiding in plain sight and you need to trust your judgment. Warren thought Geico was a great business, but all the insurance analyst told him it was it and he had to trust himself. Sam zemurry on bananas and Jerry jones was the 75th person pitched the cowboys. Build a business natural to you follow your unique differentiation. He would ask the top coal companies. Which competitor they would buy if they couldn’t buy their own in which they would sell short. Align company philosophy with your interests. Fortunes weren’t built with diversification.

Transcript:
David Senra
So I want to start out with Charlie Munger talking about the importance of creating your own luck by following your curiosity and your intense interest. And so Charlie says, Warren says he was lucky to find Geico, but not every 21-year was going to go down to Washington, D.C., start knocking on the doors of empty buildings to try to find Something out that he was curious about. So we also made our own luck by being curious and seeking wisdom. Buffett adds to this, if you enjoy what you're doing, you are likely to get a better result than if you go to work with your teeth clenched every morning. My favorite, they say variations of the same ideas. Obviously, they repeat the importance of repetition is persuasive. But my favorite way that they ever said this is Munger said, intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you're going to excel in it. In fact, there's a great quote from this guy named Naval Ravikant that really echoes a lot of Buffett and Munger's ideas, what they're saying about here. And especially in the age of infinite leverage, how important, I think that idea only becomes more important. It's definitely something I'm betting my life and career on. But Naval said, if you're not 100% into it, somebody else who is 100% into it will outperform you. And they won't just outperform you by a little

Every experience with a customer is a debit or credit if it’s goodwill with that customer.
Steve heard the ideas of many of the creative people in the company and sometimes he would just digest the info other times he’d connect it across the company with a different idea Steve the synthesizer. Often apples creations were a surprise to people in the company small compounding growth.
Steve Jobs decided to take Pixar public after the release of toy story so four days after the release Pixar had its IPO this was preplanned as Steve knew it would be a huge success and Disney Moana renegotiate terms of them and give them a three movie contract but once they saw the success of Pixar as a genuine competitor they would not be as forgiving and play hardball having full equality would allow them To call their own shots and maintain this was a key strategic move.
A business is an idea that makes someone’s life better
Steve and Johnny Ive decided on what success meant and it wasn’t about share price it was about if they were really proud of the product they were created and the experience of consumers.

His first opportunity was TV which she didn’t wanna do, but he had to take his opportunity. Always nervous throwing up before ever seen still at 60. His career stalls multiple times and he has to recover and reinvent. He thought visually and was a good person which gets you far. Positive forward motion regardless of internal suffering. Jaws comes after his biggest failure he didn’t even want to do the movie questing conventional wisdom can be very profitable. He wanted to give up on jaws many times thought it would be a flop went over budget and timing 3 times the shark literally broke people around him helped him see it through with unique problem solving. He thought his career was over and it was the biggest movie ever made. He had bad cost management but used his biggest loss 1941 to raiders of the lost arc where he works with Lucas learned how to manage costs and raised money where he was structured to have upside which was rare. Controlling costs is how he became rich he was very resourceful. When things hit the fan he adjusts the shot to fit the situation. Prioritized family feels pressure but always meets the task. Maintains balance.

### Innovation & Unique Differentiation

**Slug:** `innovation-unique-differentiation`  
**Highlights:** 10

#### Description

Creating new value through novel approaches, unique positioning, and breakthrough innovations that redefine markets

#### Curated Highlights

##### 1. Zero to One

**Readwise ID:** 518576193  
**Author:** Peter Thiel  
**Relevance:** 9.8/10  
**Quality:** 9.5/10  
**Type:** foundational_concept  

**Note:** Distinguishes between definite vs indefinite optimism and how definite optimism drives innovation and unique differentiation

> The famous chart below from the book outlines societies in which definite optimism and pessimism are detailed. At a high level a definite optimist has a plan that will make the future better while an indefinite optimist believes the future will be better but does not have a concrete plan. Pessimism is the reverse of believe the world will be worse. The idea being that to create value you need to craft a plan and avoid as much diversification as possible. Economists/Academics believe in the value of diversification, but the hindrances are obvious. If you look at stock market returns at the end of the year and got to pick how you had invested the money, you would not pick a diversified portfolio of 100 companies you would just pick the one that did the best. While decisions are made with uncertain outcomes and diversifying idiosyncratic risk is beneficial it clearly is not optimal, but neither is definite optimism because as clear as picking the winner on Dec 31st is make the optimal bet on Jan 1st is not a one company thing as we live in a world of uncertainty. Definite optimism clashes with the idea of power law returns in this book. Maybe it is illogical to say being a definite optimist is impossible and all we can hope for is to be a semi-definite optimist. Here is where it gets a bit semantic and we drill down into Theil’s point. Indefinite Optimism is akin to planning a party outside and saying im not sure what the weather will be, but I’m confident it will be good. Versus definite optimist saying “I looked at the weather and it’s going to be 75 and sunny tomorrow.” So we need to approach a probabilistic and indefinite world in a definite way, by first anticipating problems, believing they can be solved, and coming up with a systematic way to solve them. The clash with these ideas is the definite optimism of countries like China and Russia which are mischaracterized here. They are employing their own form of definite optimism with 10 year plans and internet firewalls. They are not doing this to actively make their country worse. They believe China will be a super power which is optimistic and through their methods which in the West are viewed negatively are the way to do this. This idea loops back to the earlier idea “Conventions only appear wrong in hindsight question your reality.” This is not a digression into communism as clearly it has never proved to work and is not the optimal form of government given its nonexistent checks and balances nor is this in support of a Chinese system that suppresses the free will of it’s people and is willing to put the country over the lives of millions. The great leap forward famine caused upwards of 50 million deaths and currently millions are more or less enslaved in concentration comps. To Xi and Mao these are negative consequences of their plan which is definitely optimistic, but to the Western eye this is 1984 dystopia at its finest. All this to say, definite optimism comes in many forms and this idea is better expressed through the idea of good explanations knowing problems are inevitable and soluble.

> The entire world said they couldn’t fly but they had blinders on and focus. They weren’t focused on if but on how. They’re completely obsessed with flying but capable of thinking for themselves on new solutions. Realized that everything people thought was wrong and literally built a wind tunnel and created the basis for much aeronautical flight like lift ect. Do thing people aren’t doing. They came out of nowhere with nothing to fly literally when it was deemed impossible. Practice in private and do the work Michael Jordan. People who studied this flew for 5 hours in 5 years they were afraid of failure and death. These guys worked until midnight after working 12-14 hours.
Test iterate work long hours concentrate. Turned down outside money they were missionaries.
Give your brain time for diffusive learning.
Choose conflict over agreement it always yields a better result. Wilbur would take nothing lying down he would fight all ideas in order to improve them.
They had people helping with their work but once they left their focus accelerated drastically.

**Type:** foundational_concept  

**Note:** Licklider's vision of human-computer symbiosis shows how breakthrough innovation comes from reimagining fundamental relationships

> Lick collected people and ideas and became the synthesizer of much of the movement there was no leader as all the participants were very independent. Lock wrote his Seminole paper on human computer symbiosis on how humans worked with computers which laid out how humans and computers could work together and described the ideas of network centers a shared connected library of computers the first idea of the internet. Computers lick saw could not only mitigate monotony but enhance creativity and create models. A model is any convienient simulation of reality but some models carry a lot more weight and truth than others these are static vs dynamic models. Static just exist while dynamic models change with the world. Computers allowed for static programs that didn’t change but code was infinitely malleable. With code you could model a plane or a mathematical equation a static model executed in a computer and as it’s executed it’s dynamic and while basic models may just output text some models could create universes where the model reacts to the user and likewise. Computers allow peoples mental models the most complex of all models to be aided as computers are great at digesting complexity and humans aren’t. Information is dynamic and knowledge can take on codification through coding languages. The issue with mental models is they exist in peoples heads but if you could outwardly express a model and people could agree on it you can have more second level conversations and you can only get past the first level by understanding and critiquing the other persons base model.

**Note:** Explains how successive versions and iteration create innovation that's both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could plan

> How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned. It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.

> Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts. Instead, they undergo what researchers call a “sampling period.” They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.

> **Elon's Management Principles**

- Technical managers must have hands-on experience (e.g., software team managers coding 20% of their time).
- Avoid excessive camaraderie, which can hinder constructive criticism.
- It’s acceptable to be wrong, but avoid being confidently wrong.
- Never ask your team to do something you're unwilling to do yourself.
- Solve problems by doing skip-level meetings with employees below your managers.
- When hiring, prioritize attitude over skills, as skills are teachable.
- Operate with a maniacal sense of urgency; remember that all rules are recommendations except those dictated by physics.

Transcript:
David Senra
These are, I consider these like the postscripts to the algorithm. Number one, all technical managers must have hands-on experience. For example, managers of software teams must spend at least 20% of their time coding. Solar roof managers must spend time on the roofs doing installations. Otherwise, they're like a cavalry leader who can't ride a horse or a general who can't use a sword. Number two, camaraderie is dangerous. It makes it hard for people to challenge each other's work. There is a tendency to not want to throw a colleague under the bus. That needs to be avoided. Number three, it's okay to be wrong, just don't be confident and wrong. Number four, never ask your troops to do something you're not willing to do. Number five, whenever there are problems to solve, don't just meet with your managers. Do a skip level where you meet with the level right below your managers. You'll see many times Elon just goes to the people that are actually doing the actual work. Number six, when hiring, look for people with the right attitude. Skills can be taught. Attitude change requires a brain transplant. Seven, a maniacal sense of urgency is our operating principle. Eight, the only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics. Everything else is a recommendation.

> Tracking your habits can help you keep the streak alive can be inherently motivating and instantly rewarding casting votes on who you want to become. When you fail once it’s ok but don’t miss twice in a row. Once you get to 2-3 in a row you’re starting a new trend it’s important just to accept the failure and get back after it to continue building on the macro trend. Doing something not putting up a 0. It’s ok to not have an A+ work out but just showing up yo keep the cycle compounding is more important than anything. Don’t interrupt compounding unnecessarily. We optimize for what we measure but just because we can or can’t measure something it’s not valuable or bad. Goodharts law when the measure becomes the objective the original goal is bastardized.

> A Story about Mindless Imitation

Key takeaways:
- Buffett and Munger believe that it is important to understand human behavior in order to run a successful business.
- Charlie Munger describes the phenomenon of imitation as the three eyes. He says that you get what he calls the natural progression, the three eyes, the innovators, the imitators, and the idiots.
- Buffett and Munger believe that it is important to read, think, and form your own opinions in order to avoid being influenced by others.

Speaker 1
Buffet says, you really should understand human behavior if you're going to run a business. Munger says, once you have the ideas, of course, you must continuously practice, amen, something you and I talk about over and over again. Once you have the ideas, of course, you must continuously practice their use. If you don't practice, you can't perform well. A wise man engaged in learning some important skill will not stop until he is really fluent in it. So more on this idea of it's really important if you're going to run a business to understand human nature. Again, this is all these ideas. These are not on the same page. So this is how you know it's important to them because what's important to people, they will repeat. And so this is really, it's a story about imitation is the note that I left myself when I read this. But no, with Charlie's about to tell us, he's telling us a story about human nature. That's very fascinating. And if you think about like their bird's eye view that they've had in the like the finance industry, which, you know, it's been full of panics and bubbles and booms and busts, right? This is just absolutely fantastic. So Charlie Munger says, one of my favorite stories is about the little boy in Texas. The teacher asked the class, if there are nine sheep in the pen and one jumps out, how many are left? And everybody got the answer right, except this little boy who said, none of them are left. And the teacher said, you don't understand arithmetic. And he said, no teacher, you don't understand sheep. And Buffett adds on to the story by saying, it always amazes me how high IQ people mindlessly imitate. And then Buffett describes this phenomenon by this idea. He calls the three eyes. And so he says, you get what I call the natural progression, the three eyes, the innovators, the imitators, and the idiots. So skipping ahead, let's go back to this idea that they repeat over and over again. Spend a lot of time thinking, reading, formulating your own thoughts and mute the world. And so Buffett says, we do not read other people's opinions. We want to think. We want to get the facts and then think. This was such a like a mind blowing realization. Because you never know when like when you're reading something, when it just, it's going to something click or like kind of interact with maybe an idea that was previous in your mind or you didn't, you didn't, weren't necessarily like completely understood how important it was.

**Note:** Provides non-consensus insight about power laws in stock returns: 2% of companies create 90% of wealth - hidden truth most miss

> The 2% Rule: Success in Investment

Summary:
Research shows that in the last century, 60% of companies failed to earn Treasury bill rates, leading to a loss of $9 trillion, while the top 2% of companies created 90% of the $55 trillion wealth.

This pattern is consistent globally with 64,000 companies analyzed worldwide. As an investor, the focus should be on identifying companies that create value, as a few high-performing companies can significantly impact an investment portfolio.

The approach in investment discussions revolves around being optimistic, seeking out potential successes, maintaining exhaustive research efforts, and ensuring commitments are followed through till the end without losing out on opportunities.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
The basic setup is he looked at all public companies since 1926 and what he found was just under 60%. So he's just got to let that number sit in your head 60% fail to earn treasury bill rates. So by his reckoning, they destroyed $9 trillion of wealth. The other little over 40% did create value. They earn above treasury bill rates and they created an aggregate $64 trillion of wealth. These numbers are through 2022, by the way. And so 64 months nine is $55 trillion of aggregate wealth creation, US market in the last called century or so. But what's fascinating to your point, Patrick, and this is where the venture capital ask statistic is that 2% of those companies created 50 trillion of the 55 trillion. So 2% of the companies were 90% of value. You can even go down a bit. The handful of companies were actually a fairly substantial percentage, including Apple and so forth. So obviously venture, the average bill, I think, said it's expanding out. But let's say the average venture fund is 10 years, but we have data on the returns for 30,000 venture investments over the last quarter century or so. And yeah, 55 or 60% lose money. It's actually not dissimilar at all. And then you get some that make money and then you got your right tails that pull up the whole portfolio. So as Bill mentioned, that you need to capture the extreme events to make the whole portfolio go. So one is looking at a century. And others looking at it's called a decade, but you're getting sort of the same essential, almost like a fractal pattern. The other thing to say is interesting is that best and binder also collaborate with some folks, academics, and looked at the same markets outside the United States. So they look at in aggregate, 64,000 companies, including developing and developed markets around the world. Same basic patterns help true. Really is interesting. So as an investor, obviously you say to yourself, if this is the pattern, I'm sure Bill and his colleagues think a lot about this, but if this is a pattern, how should we behave? That becomes the interesting question. Should we try to identify those companies? Do we want to make sure that we own those at the kind of errors we make, we have to own the guy. The companies are going to create all the value. Even if we own some of the bad ones, it doesn't really make a difference. If we own the good ones, it's going to make up for it all day and then some.

Speaker 3
If we were to be a fly on the wall in a Monday all day benchmark partner discussion with this topic in mind, what sorts of things does that then constantly bring up amongst you and your partners As you're considering an investment? Like if we're going to heed this truth and you just said you can't miss the huge ones and if you go into Coyle, they'll all talk about like be the person that finds the next logo that goes On that wall. This seems to be like the game that everyone's playing. What does that feel like tactically every Monday as you're talking about founders and customers? What are the sorts of questions that forces you to ask of young companies?

Speaker 2
So a couple of different things. One is just to embrace that attitude. I think Bruce came back from reading one of Ridley's book and used the phrase what could go right at a partner meeting. It's very easy, especially with a big group, with a group bigger than about five, it's very easy to fall into cynicism as a sport to start taking shots at stuff. And so having this what could go right at it to in other words, make the primary part of the discussion how big could this be rather than trying to nitpick whether or not it might fail. And so that's one. Two, I think it requires just exhausted behavior. You can't stop looking. How would you know that you looked under every rock? There's no way to know that other than to be exhaustive about it. And so creating a culture where everyone feels that responsibility is important. And then, you know, never lose at the finish line, never, ever, ever lose at the finish line. And once you've made a decision as a firm that it's something you want to be in, make it happen. How would you do that? Well, now you're getting into the secret sauce. Maybe give you like the saffron or like one ingredient in that. Well, I mean, you have to have built the right relationships. You have to call in the right favors from a refutational standpoint so that you're bringing the reference calls to the finish line. The tiresome don't lose on price.

Summary:
Trust in management and the purpose of opportunities is critical when investing.

True investors focus on understanding businesses deeply rather than merely discussing asset ownership. Utilizing comprehensive resources, such as the Value Line Investment Survey, lays the foundation for analytical skills.

The journey to an encyclopedic knowledge demands persistence; reading entire texts is essential for mastery.

The willingness to engage deeply in one's education sets apart the dedicated from the indifferent, as the vast majority will not invest the effort to thoroughly understand complex material.

In other words, bad boys move in silence, but I can pick a couple examples of something that I owned in the past. And he's using this as an illustration, or I guess an example of how he thought about how he thinks about investing. And so during this he's holding this giant book. So value it's the value line investment survey, which is a stock analysis, tracks approximately, you know, 1700 something like publicly traded stocks is giant book. And he's trying to walk the students through on how to analyze businesses that are in this book. And so again, Lee Liu, just like Churchill, just like most the people you and I studied, they devour entire shell. So he's like, I got hooked on value line. And I would read the entire thing from beginning to end. He says that's really the best kind of education. If you want to have an encyclopedic knowledge base, you have to go through page after page after page. Doing so is just enormously helpful. And if you really think about the idea behind the idea, like what is he trying to tell the students? He's like, how bad do you want it? That right there, the amount of people are going to read cover to cover this giant book that it's in the video. It looks like you can work out with the thing. How many people willing to do that? Right there, it's gonna eliminate like 95 or greater than 95% of people.

> Building Mental Models for Success

Summary:
Success is heavily reliant on decision-making prowess, as being right a higher percentage of the time can yield exponential value.

The key lies in leveraging modern technology and resources to enhance decision-making skills. This involves understanding that the brain operates as a memory prediction machine, requiring the application of mental models rather than relying on past events for future predictions.

Mental models derived from evolution, game theory, and influential figures like Charlie Munger and Nassim Taleb are crucial for making informed decisions.

Embracing complexity theory and acknowledging the limits of prediction capabilities can help navigate uncertainty effectively.

Success is not just about making correct judgments but also about avoiding mistakes by eliminating what may not work. By employing mental models to assess trust, odds, and margin of safety, one can make informed decisions. Adopting a system-oriented approach, instead of fixed goals, allows individuals to create conducive environments for success, focusing on statistical likelihood for positive outcomes.

Making is everything. And in fact, someone who makes decisions right 80% of the time, so 70% of the time, will be valued and compensated in the market hundreds of times more.

00 million worth of value on a judgment call. And with modern technology and large workforces and capital, our decision is getting leveraged more and more. So if you can be more right, more rational, and that's one of the reasons why I love your blog, because it really focuses on helping you be more right, better decision making and more rational, Then you're going to just get non-linear returns in your life. So decision making is everything. And decision making, what's going on? Basically, the brain is a memory prediction machine. It has a memory of things that work in the past and what it's read and it's trying to predict the future. And the lousy way to do memory prediction is X happened in the past, therefore X will happen in the future. It's too based on specific circumstances. So what you want is you want principle, you want mental models. So the best mental models that I have found have come through Evolution, Game Theory, and Charlie Munger, who I'm sure you quote a lot in your blog, but Charlie Munger was Warren Buckett's Partner, very good investor, but he has tons and tons of great mental models. Naseem Taleb has great mental models. The Benjamin Franklin had great mental models. So I basically load my head full of mental models. But then different ones apply to every situation. So I don't really want to checklist. But for example, I studied a lot of complexity theory when I was younger. It's a field that I got into. I got an occasion I just get into these things and I just learn a lot about that field. And my most recent one is cryptography, but I was really into complexity theory back in the mid 90s. And the more I got into it, the more I understand the limits of our knowledge and the limits of our prediction capability. And that's been super helpful to me. So that has helped me come to the system that operates in the face of ignorance. And I believe that fundamentally we're ignorant and very, very bad at predicting the future. So I don't look for, and I don't believe that I have the ability to say what is going to work. So rather what I try to do is I try to eliminate what's not going to work. So I think being successful is just about not making mistakes. It's not about having correct judgments. It's about avoiding the incorrect judgments. So I have mental models around how do I determine if I can trust somebody around what are the actual odds that this is going to work? How much margin of safety do I have? If it works out, the angel bets and venture bets are great because they've not been your outcome in the positive, but on the downside, you can only lose one X. But on the upside, you can make 10,000 X. So I try to rig the game. So I don't believe in specific goals. Scott Adams also set up systems, not goals. So use your judgment to figure out what kinds of environments you can thrive in and then build a system to create that environment around you so that you're statistically likely to succeed.

**Note:** Complex adaptive systems are perpetual novelty - they struggle to find global maximum and are constantly changing, core definition of continuous evolution

> A complex adaptive system has many levels of organization with lower level building blocks forming higher level organisms and on and on ie a cell is made of atoms and a human is made of cells and a community is made a humans and a city is made of communities and there are different levels of interaction between all these levels actions at any level will impact actions at every other level. Constantly revising and changing as new information comes in and is reacted to. All these process if learning adapting and evolution are the same and one way they do this is through building blocks modifications and these systems are predictive and reactive. Complex adaptive systems struggle to find a global maximum and stable equilibrium often they struggle jumping from place to place due to competition the most they can do is change and improve wrt other agents complex adaptive systems are perpetual novelty. The issue with economics is making a science out of imperfect agents exploring a limitless problem space of possible solutions. You can do trillions of things we can’t assume we’re always going to do the right thing or even close. Chess a small number of rules can create an incomprehensibly infinite amount of states all leading to 3 clear outcomes. Same with science built on simple laws but these laws create the amazing and complex reality that we live in its reductionist but the interactions create something infinitely complex and magnificent. Create a model of an opponent and using that model to create predictions of the best line of play ie AI. Through a microscope the brain seems to be completely chaotic but the brain clearly produces clear thought and action from this chaos so it isn’t random. The brain is also not static as it revises its models and learns. The organization of behavior by heb brain makes small synaptic changes which form the basis for all learning and memory comes in from one way and strengths the impulses it runs through creating a neural path so a previously thought random network becomes an organized learning loop with often used synapses growing stronger and weaker synapses atrophying eventually memory is encoded in synapses selective strengthening then different paths collectively form subroutines based on groups of synapses and this forms the base for thought and knowledge these small assemblies organize into bigger structures forming the fundamental quantum of thought. Neural networks abstract connections between nodes with different weights that through time go up or down because they receive the desired or undesired results

**Note:** Life exists at edge of chaos where learning and evolution guide beings - shows adaptation happens at boundary between order and chaos

> Artificial life is the idea that the laws of life are not through analysis like conventional biology but understanding. Life by synthesis putting simple pieces of the life puzzle together to create characteristics. Life is not matter but an organization of that matter. The laws of life must be laws of dynamic form regardless of being carbon based life forms. Ie life on other planners can be life without any of the biological similarities essence of life only when we view life as what it could be will we understand life as it truly is. While organizations build top down life comes bottom up with key pieces being formed through simplicity but very complex things can come out of very few and simple building blocks. Why due to entropy at a small scale things are trending towards chaos while at a larger scale things are able to former high levels of order such as stars and galaxies low level disorder leading to an emergent property of order. Connectionism the power lies in the connections very simple initiatial states like neurons for connections of subroutines that create the basis for knowledge complex outcomes from simple inputs. So you can build on old connectors building sustaining knowledge or do the equivalent of ripping connections out which is disruptive learning. Local vs global maximums. The essence is in the connections not the base inputs. Life exists at the edge of chaos where order and chaos overlapping form complexity. Entities trend towards the edge of chaos because it is evolutionarily optimal. Learning and evolution guide beings through history on the edge of chaos leading to more order through time and more complexity

> approach emphasize increasing returns bounded rationality and the dynamics of evolution and learning instead of static equilibrium perfect information and decreasing returns. Instead of convenient assumptions they would try to make psychologically realistic models. Think of the world as a dynamic ever changing system at the edge of chaos. Problem contexts aren’t well defined and environment is not stationary but you still need to learn in the environment. Prediction isn’t the essence of science the essence is comprehension and explanations. You can design an auto catalytic system with self replicating entities that can do things much quicker than expected. Ie from these basic building blocks life can be created much quicker. Random reactions happen but if we have chemical catalysis this can super charge life if you had these building blocks floating around you could crate life more rapidly than just random luck. Co evolution nothing happens in a bubble when one thing in the environment changes the things in its niche co evolve and adapt cheeta becomes really fast to chase down gazelles and as a reaction gazelles get fast to avoid cheetas. Tit for tat cooperation was the optimal game theory strategy to maximize outcomes. Opening with kindness and if the other program responds kindly likewise continue the positive feedback if negative response mirror that as well this blends tough and fair with an optimistic tilt which while simple is either optimal or near optimal for long continuing relationships one off might be different so eventually because it’s highest ev this style will be dominant

Good rules and simple rules can create very complex systems with good self organizational structure think genetic code is only 4 letters. Self organization is a matter of source or evolutionary raw material with highly variable source/stock of information from which to select patterns and a means for experimentation for selecting and testing new patterns. This is why diversity in systems is vital. A system that scorns experimentation or insistence on one way cuts back resilience a system that wipes out the raw material of innovation is doomed.

> Great syntheses across disciplines that United grand theories. A grand theory not for the simple but also for complex emergent structures. The origin of life is too intricate to be discovered by accident there has to be some deeper structure of knowledge that governs life. Are we really a miracle or is life finding a way because higher level emergent behaviors from complex systems tend to organize in a certain way and lead to the structures we see in our world. Is life finding a way or on a crash course with a deeper theory of complex systems. The copper atom on Winston Churchill’s nose getting there with simple or complex explanations. Auto catalytic sets means life could’ve bootstrapped it way into existence through very simple molecules which reacted with each other and created a chain of reactions that eventually sparked life as in life is the product of catalytic reactions and then further weather could’ve mixed these two primordial chemical reactions and created a natural selection between these two auto catalytic reactions therefore jump starting life. Natures desire for self organization. Natural laws of auto catalytic sets - how many polymers are there and how many catalysts cause a reaction between the two because catalysts scale faster than polymers there would have to be a probability that these reactions would occur with some complexity given the probability there would almost have to be a reaction and life would have to form. Amino acids make polymer chains leads to life. Economy has good and services which are the amino acids of the reaction. Innovations result from old technologies once you get to a certain level of complexity the economy reaches an escape velocity if you increase complexity over a point your economy can take off. If you inject another molecule into the auto catalytic set it could completely disrupt and destroy the reaction this is the idea of disruption. We get the starts of models for notable revolutions.

> Embrace Change: Adaptation Over Time

Summary:
Natural selection has consistently favored genetic variations that reduce body fat and susceptibility to conditions like type 2 diabetes over the past 10,000 years.

This trend suggests a shift from a feast-and-famine lifestyle to one where food availability is more stable, making the ability to store fat less advantageous. Such adaptation challenges the notion that agriculture led to negative health outcomes, instead indicating a complex response to changing environmental conditions.

The immune thing makes sense, obviously, in what diseases. In what direction is the metabolic thing pointing?

Speaker 1
So one example of this is that there's a very clear downward selection against body fat. Interesting. Against predisposition to high body medicine decks, predisposition to what today manifests itself as type 2 diabetes. So that genetic combination in West Eurasia has been pushed down again and again over the last 10,000 years under the pressure of natural selection without a doubt in its action on many, Many independent genetic variants, all pushing in the same direction in an overwhelmingly statistically significant way. One possible interpretation of this, and this is speculative, is that you're shifting from a mode of survival that's more feast and famine to one where food is more regular, and it's Not as advantageous to store fat. And so there's selection against sort of fat storage capacity.

Speaker 2
That story seems to point against the narrative that agriculture was terrible.

Composed of agents that once aggregated take on collective charistics create effects that couldn’t be manifested or predicted from the individual agent. Whole greater than the sum of its part simple rules create complex outcomes ie ant colony. Collective non linear outcome of a complex System is its emergent behavior.

> Invention of cell phones – The cellular network vs the picture phone was one that benefited from network effects as well as optimized the use of scarce resources. Cell phones had limited radio frequencies available so instead having powerful towers the network used less power so frequencies can be reused when they were out of range of another tower using their frequency. The towers were organized in hexagons to optimize space they were cells of hexagons ergo the cellular network. Instead of increasing power they inverted to get more out of the limited frequencies available. The benefit of this system is because it used the already installed radio base everyone had access to everyone else and there was already an existing network effect.

> Moving from reductionism to complexity. What are the building blocks of life ie electrons and quarks but then how do these fundamental uniform qualities form completely different and unpredictable systems. Complex adaptive systems. When it came to real world complexity’s fancy equations and elegant mathematics were no more than limited tools and the key tool was insight the ability to see complex connections. Economics was predictive of obvious things taking a simple idea and complicating it with math while neutralizing it with assumptions that destroyed the ideas pure essence. While they predicted things like taxation and inflation the theories didn’t compensate or explain the fundamentally messy world that existed it was too reductionist for it Self organization depends on self reinforcement for a soup to boil it needs a constant flame or else it will sit at room temperature positive feedback loops. Small changes create big changes one molecule moves slightly faster because it’s slightly warmer and soon enough they’re all zipping around unpredictably Instead of decreasing returns and efficiency over time there can be increasing returns like the pilgrims wanted to go to Virginia but their boat drifted off course and they landed in mass and set up a colony there had they landed in Virginia as planned the world would look different and they didn’t just move to Virginia they set up a whole society due to an accident completely unpredictable events lead to a chain that may be unable to stop and was unable to fully predict but changes literally every event after it because of increasing returns in chaotic systems The essence of science isn’t prediction it’s good explanations you don’t know what species is next in the human evolution but that doesn’t nullify Darwin’s theory. Good explanations is the core of science After a discovery there becomes lock in which produces increasing returns we don’t use the QWERTY keyboard because it’s efficient it was designed to be inefficient so type writers didn’t break but now everyone uses it so no one can really switch without high switching costs and the marginal gain is negligible for the risk of production/ market fit.

Plan today for tomorrow’s problems not firefighting. Planning is a managers goal. Create a clear plan with milestones it’s clear what you’re saying yes and no to. MBO system is more focused on results than method if you achieve your goal a different way you still win despite not doing it the way you thought. Clear goals flexible execution.

> Plan flow around processing time and limiting steps in a process. Process data assemble information test plans. Constantly using unit tests everything is a constraint optimization problem. Trade off man power vs materials vs quality to find the best combination. Do unit testing. Make sure to make corrections as early in the process as possible finished goods cost more than inputs so throwing out a rotten egg when you get it is better than serving it. Likewise create key successs metrics around process and quality. Need go measure and balance inventory levels and quality metrics and process. Match input and countable measure with quality metric both need to be quantifiable. Process is a black box leading indicators give you a look into the black box try to get as much info as possible about the box a look into the box but these must also be good indicators or else the headstart isn’t helpful. Stagger chart show your projections with the expected demand cycle for that product so if demand is seasonal you project around that to better deploy resources. Build to order vs build to forecast which is riskier. Parkinson’s law the work people do conform to the then they’re asked to do it not the actual task.

Start with the minimum actionable problem to get the ball rolling some problems are too big or abstract to attack so break it down to an mvp see what you can attack then go after it. First frame the problem then strip out the fluf and reframe when you’re trying to get to the root of the problem. Reframe and prototype smaller problems trying and adjusting to see what works understand your blind spots and biases where the reality gap exists if you’re not getting feedback is there a personal root issue with how you work or is it the situation. Some problems are intractable the world isn’t tests and linear systems but nonlinear solutions. Couples with intractable problems figure out a way to work around their problems understanding that they can’t solve it so they work together to manage it for their combined benefit. Create the best doable option constraint optimization problem. Come up with the finite alternatives then decide. Sometimes a global max is too intractable and your return on time is too low that you need to satisfice and move on. You can’t always have a global truth and you need to accept that so it doesn’t paralyze you. Sometimes you need to think then you need to just act and make a choice.

**Note:** Shows constraint vs permission cultures - constraint culture constrains directionality and eliminates risk surfaces, leaving space for innovation and judgment

> Empower Through Constraints, Not Permissions

Summary:
Organizations can adopt either a permission culture, where individuals must seek approval before acting, or a constraint culture, where individuals are free to act unless explicitly prohibited.

In a permission culture, people are often paralyzed by the need for consent, leading to a lack of initiative and an environment where accountability is diminished, as illustrated by the reluctance to take on tasks outside defined roles. Conversely, a constraint culture fosters empowerment by establishing clear boundaries within which individuals can operate autonomously.

This enables greater innovation and creativity, as people are encouraged to use their judgment and work within the parameters set by the organization’s goals and policies.

For example, a constraint culture can set financial thresholds for spending, granting individuals the freedom to make decisions that drive the business forward without unnecessary delays.

Ultimately, the choice between these cultures significantly influences decision-making processes and shapes the organization’s potential for growth and adaptability.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
You can have a permission culture or a constraint culture. So a permission culture is a culture where you guessed it, you have to ask permission to do anything. So the default assumption is you can't do anything until you're told that you can. So the bathroom pass that you had in school, perfect example of a permission culture, you can't even go to the bathroom without asking. That's how badly we're going to drill that into your head. And so that way you understand that that's how the world works. And there are so many examples of this in the form of instructions and protocols and guidelines and manuals and all that. And permission can come in many forms. It can come in the form of like a promotion. Like now you're the head of marketing. So now you get to make choices about what we invest our money in, but that's still a form of permission. It's still me giving you this position that I have gained to put you in. And permission cultures tend to have a problem, which is that they then have to define everything because to your point earlier about judgment, there's no room for judgment in a permission Culture unless you have the permission already. So you get a lot of people sitting on their hands. And these are the sorts of cultures where a leader will walk into the room and the trash hasn't been taken out and people will say, not my job. It's not my job to take the trash out. It's her job to take the trash out. So I'm not going to do it because I only do what I'm told. So that's one option. The other option is the culture of constraint, which is the absolute inverse. So you can do anything unless we say that you can't. So now our job with our agreements and our policies and our processes and our roles and our team structures is to clarify what the edges are to actually constrain the system in some way, Shape, or form. So when we create a purpose statement for the organization in a constraint culture, we're actually constraining directionality. We're saying like the vector of this company is towards we're going to be, you know, we're going to get the world on electric cars. So that I've descoped the rest of the stuff that we could do. We're not going to make mops. We're going to make electric cars. I sort of focused our energy and a hiring process is a constraint where I say instead of doing all the possible ways of hiring, we're going to hire this way. A, you know, a policy about harassment, anti-harassment policy is a constraint. It's basically saying don't do this. So I've eliminated this option from the surface area of all possible options. What's cool about building a constraint-based culture is when you eliminate all those risk surfaces that are what we call not safe to try or like fatal, what's left is all this space, All this space to think. So if I say it's not mops and it's not cars, you get everything else. And so the room for people to innovate and use judgment and use creativity and solving problems is just massively higher. And they get to navigate that. Now they're not used to that. So for an example, like we have a constraint in our system that if you spend more than **Readwise ID:** 757736197

0,000 on something, you should probably seek advice first. But anything under that, it's like, you know, use your human judgment. We trust you, do what's best for the business, right? Spend the money like it was your own. So somebody engaging with that who's coming from a permission culture is like, I need a new computer. What can I spend? And they freak out and they literally freak out and they start like trying to talk to other people and like, can I get the MacBook Pro? Can I get the extra RAM? Like, what should I do? Give me permission. And the system is like, no, there's no permission for that. You already have permission to do that. You only need to seek advice if you're over a limit. You just need to use your own judgment. And it's this first moment often in many people's careers where they're like, holy shit, I'm 100% trusted. And I don't even know how to operate in this judgment space of like, how much should I spend? So they didn't really answer your question yet, but that's the bedrock of the answer to your question is once we know which of those lanes we're in, permission or constraint, then we Know how to approach decision making for the next layer of the cake.

- The time to produce a product at the Japanese factory was 10 times faster than at the Ford factory
- BCG's previous strategies were based on cost, but the time advantage sparked a focus on strategy, including speed and competition

Well, if you come back to the Japanese and Ford example, you know Japanese factory that was Three times as complex Half the size and twice as pro productive The I didn't mention the time to mention the product went to that factory 10 times faster than through the Ford factory 10 times faster you know the 20% productivity advantage was about About a 20% cost advantage. This is a big number for a automotive component But the time advantage was 10 times. That's what triggered our thinking about strategy Because up until then BCG was Predominant strategies were based on cost. How do I have lower cost in your how do I help you have lower cost in your competitors? And that as I mentioned drove us to scale and focus Uh, but here's time Here's another here's the next another dimension people aren't managing And what could you do with 10 times the speed that was the question we started asking. How could you compete with that? Well, I was one of the early applications of that which I could compete Uh with next day delivery versus delivery every two weeks And if I could have next day delivery to the merchants That allowed the merchants to order more frequently and operate with less capital. That's how that's where the advantage kicked in And so that's where cost and time worked out. We had we added costs to the process to get time out the other side

> Insights from Shreya Stoshy: Three Levels of Product Work and Conflict Origins

Key takeaways:
- Conflict between people and teams can arise when they are not aligned on the level at which they are talking.
- The three levels of product work that can lead to conflict are the execution level, the impact level, and the optics level.
- Misalignment in communication levels can cause confusion and stress among individuals and teams.
- Product managers and engineers often focus on the execution level, while executives tend to prioritize the impact level.
- Leaders of different teams may fixate on different levels, such as optics, impact, or execution, leading to inter-team conflict.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
So the execution level, the impact level and the optics level. Can you expand on these levels and where conflict arises?

Speaker 1
Yeah, for sure. So this took me many years, almost two decades of working on product set mainly at high tech companies to really realize. Oftentimes, conflict between people and teams arises mainly because we're not talking at the same level. We might have similar missions and similar goals and OKRs and whatnot, but if we are not aligned on the level at which we are talking, that can lead to a lot of confusion, a lot of stress Among individuals and teams. And so the three levels of product work that I discovered through my observations were the execution level, the impact level and the optics level. Oftentimes, there would be product managers or other folks on my team who would be very nervous before presenting to an executive. Maybe it's a product strategy or something else. And they'd be very nervous. And so I'd have a conversation with them about like, hey, nervousness is normal in these situations, etc. But what's really going on? What is your real concern? And so they'd often point to past examples where they would say, oh, I was talking to the CEO in this last product review and I shared with them exact details of how we can make these goals More ambitious or whatever the case might be. And that just did not land with the executive. And I shared all the details with them, but I felt like they were confused and now they've asked for this other product review. And so now I'm frustrated. And in that example, my observation is that, again, it's the case of people talking and expecting different levels where somebody who's close to the ground, like a product manager Or an engineer, you are fixated at the extent of the product. And I'm not fixated at the execution level, which is, you know, what is it that I can get done in a short amount of time with the resources and constraints I have. Okay, so that's the execution level. But oftentimes in these situations, the executive, the CEO, wants to start at the impact level. They are more concerned about, well, is this product going to resonate? Fine, we'll build the product, but how are we going to sell the product? Have we thought about compelling ways to do that? And how is this going to affect the company's brand? Right, so they want to start with the level of the impact and they want to engage in a dialogue with you of how we can make the best possible impact. But then if you come into this kind of product review as the product manager and you can not drown the group in all sorts of execution level detail, which you think are the right things To share because these are challenges you're facing right now. If you lead with that, you are going to lose the audience. And this is merely just one example of where executives are probably thinking at the impact level, product managers or engineers are thinking at the execution level. And I've also encountered team issues, inter-team issues, famously, that many organizations where two teams can't work together and they complain. And each team complains that we can't work well with this other team. Even in those situations, I've often found that it's actually the leaders of the team that are fixating on different things. Maybe the leader of one team is very optics focused, so they are thinking about what are the optics going to look like if we combine our forces together and work on this initiative, how Can we make sure that my team gets the credit that it deserves for doing this work.

> The decision maker of experience has at his disposal a checklist of things to watch out for before finally accepting a decision. A large part of the difference between the experienced decision maker and the novice in these situations is not any particular intangible like “judgment” or “intuition.” If one could open the lid, so to speak, and see what was in the head of the experienced decision-maker, one would find that he had at his disposal repertoires of possible actions; that he had checklists of things to think about before he acted; and that he had mechanisms in his mind to evoke these, and bring these to his conscious attention when the situations for decisions arose.  Most of what we do is to get people ready to act in situations of encounter consists of drilling in these lists into them sufficiently deeply so that they will be evoked quickly at the time of the decision.

If the thing that is being made more efficient is beneficial, then the increased efficiency makes the world a better place (overall, the world [seems to be becoming a better place](https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts)). If the thing that is being made more efficient is socially harmful, then the consequences of greater efficiency are scary or depressing (think mass surveillance, or robotic weapons). What about the most common case though — where the thing we are making more efficient is related, but not identical, to beneficial outcomes? What happens when we get better at something which is merely correlated with outcomes we care about?

In that case, we can overfit, the same as we do in machine learning. The outcomes we care about will improve for a while ... and then they will grow dramatically worse.

What is the advantage to doing that? So there's a couple of things, a couple of bits of advice buried in a book about that. One is this rule, which was actually based on some research in various different fields of life that when you're trying to optimize something versus trying to explore where you have something that works and you just want to make it better and optimize it versus doing the inefficient thing of going out to try something new. And it comes down to something like when you go out to eat at a restaurant, do you get your favorite thing that you know works or do you try something that is a new dish that may not work? So the ratio is actually one to three, two to three, one to three. So you actually want to spend two thirds of your time trying to optimize things that you want to go deeper and better and then a third trying new things and that's been shown in many, many ways to be roughly true.

- VCs often overlook patience and capital efficiency, focusing more on the size of the opportunity and the speed of growth.
- Building a great company with smart management and sustainable advantages is essential for long-term value creation.
- Capital efficiency is relevant because substantial additional funding requirements can lower the compounding rate of shareholder value.
- Helping companies become profitable quickly allows for more patience and higher rates of return.
- Altos places less emphasis on conventional VC metrics and focuses on sustainable growth and survival.
- Self-actualization in the business process requires time, survival, reliance on others' goodwill, and good luck.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
I want to just read from one of those early blogs because it does highlight I think some of the elements of differentiation across the traditional VC landscape and this comes from compounding Value in venture capital. To compound value in venture capital, two critical factors to remember are patience and capital efficiency. These factors are often overlooked by VCs who seem to care more about other issues. They ask, how big is the opportunity? It must have home run potential or how quickly can they get there? The company should have 100 million in revenue potential within five years. And how much money can be put to work? Bigger funds must deploy more capital per deal or end up with too many deals. Why is patience relevant to the discussion on compounding? Because time is required for the compounding to take effect. In Silicon Valley VCs, as well as entrepreneurs, want very fast growth rates, 100% per year or more. In contrast, we'd rather focus on building a growth engine, which can last a very long time. The only way this can happen is if we build a great company, one with smart, responsible management, sustainable competitive advantages, and a commitment to creating long-term value. There are no shortcuts. Perhaps the above point is totally obvious, but why is capital efficiency relevant? After we make an investment if substantial amounts of additional funding are required to grow, then over time, the compounding rate of shareholder value will be far lower. Myron Scholz's equation showed that death and taxes are certain enemies of compounding. So is dilution. Capital efficiency and patience are inextricably linked. Over the years, we've learned that if we help our companies become profitable quickly, we can afford to be more patient. In contrast, companies which burn through lots of capital or play venture lotto produce far lower rates of return or fail in spectacular fashion. In Altos, we place less emphasis on 100% growth or conventional VC metrics, like 100 million revenue in five years. We've seen thousands of business plans with such projections. It's like they were cut and pasted from the same VC 101 business plan. And I think one of the important lessons here to underscore is coming back to this process of self-actualization. You have to be able to survive, to give yourself the time to do this. And that was obviously critical. And in some cases, you need to rely on the goodwill of others and just plain old fashioned good luck.

**Author:** Morgan Housel  
**Relevance:** 8.2/10  
**Quality:** 8.6/10  
**Type:** practical_application  

**Note:** Debt as constraint on outcomes - as debt increases, you narrow range of endurable outcomes, limiting flexibility and options in volatile world

> I think this is the most practical way to think about debt: **As debt increases, you narrow the range of outcomes you can endure in life.**

That’s so simple. But it’s different from how debt is typically viewed, which is a tool to pull forward demand and leverage assets, where the only downside is the cost of capital (the interest rate).

Two things are important when you view debt as a narrowing of endurable outcomes.

One is you start to ponder how common volatility is.

I hope to be around for another 50 years. What are the odds that during those 50 years I will experience one or more of the following: Wars, recessions, terrorist attacks, pandemics, bad political decisions, family emergencies, unforeseen health crises, career transitions, wayward children, and other mishaps?

One-hundred percent. *The odds are 100%*.

When you think of it like that, you take debt’s narrowing of survivable outcomes seriously.

The other is you think about the kinds of volatile events that could do you in.

Financial volatility is an obvious one – you find yourself unable to make your debt payments. But there’s also psychological volatility, where for whatever reason you can’t mentally endure your job any longer. There’s family volatility, which can be anything from divorce to caring for a relative. There’s child volatility, which could fill a book. Health volatility, political volatility, on and on. The world’s a wild place.

I’m not an anti-debt zealot. There’s a time and place, and used responsibly it’s a wonderful tool.

But once you view debt as narrowing what you can endure in a volatile world, you start to see it as a constraint on the asset that matters most: having options and flexibility.

When he met Dorian grey he grew pale his eyes met and a curios terror came over him. He met someone who’d personality was so fascinating that if he allowed it to do so he would absorb his entire soul and heart and he didn’t want any external influence in his life and let this person into his soul so he ran away. This is a crazy point on love Jesus. Friendship liking everyone means being indifferent to everyone. Dorian grey captivated him so much that he’s even more present in his pictures when he’s not in them he’s become apart of basal the artist. Abstract sense of beauty is lost in the world. Only the intellectually lost argue. He’s given his soul to someone who treats it like a flower he puts in his pocket. Genius lasts longer than beauty so we overeducate ourselves because we lose our beauty but keep the mind. However we still die so we just lose beauty and the mind at different times so we should be indifferent to the 2. The faithful know the trivial sides of love the faithless truly understand loves tragedies.

> A few months later, Arendt went to study with Jaspers at the University of Heidelberg. She cut her hair, started smoking, and found a group of friends. She found stillness in her solitude, and a sense of self-belonging in Heidelberg, as she learned to keep company with herself in the quiet moments. She would always be different, but instead of experiencing her difference as something that isolated her from others, it became the foundation for how she came to love the world of being with others. Loving the world, she realised, was a choice, and an act of willing, and the beauty of being together is that one is always coming undone in the dance of knowing and unknowing.

**Note:** Shows how memetic theory applies to modern digital culture and social media dynamics

> Memes are viral ideas easily replicated. They tear through social media like wildfire because they resonate deeply. Mimetics is the idea of copying someone you admire or scapegoating someone you don’t. It creates a model for behavior to get a certain outcome. With the increase of social media in a global world mimetic desire has become more copying and less creating because it’s a lower barrier to rewards but the issue with this is that it’s leading to less originality and more copying because the models are getting stronger. We’ll create nothing soon. Group chats are a good place to form ideas in a safe space. The more the world becomes mimetic the more the world needs anti memes. The world has had the church as the meme and as anti memes the world had sex and the Underground Railroad. In this growing meme world anti memes are growing just as fast. Need public and private channels. As the forest of memes grows and becomes more important the hidden forest of anti memes grows. Need both and when one grows like the negative externality it expands as well.

- Buffett and Munger believe that it is important to read, think, and form your own opinions in order to avoid being influenced by others.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Buffet says, you really should understand human behavior if you're going to run a business. Munger says, once you have the ideas, of course, you must continuously practice, amen, something you and I talk about over and over again. Once you have the ideas, of course, you must continuously practice their use. If you don't practice, you can't perform well. A wise man engaged in learning some important skill will not stop until he is really fluent in it. So more on this idea of it's really important if you're going to run a business to understand human nature. Again, this is all these ideas. These are not on the same page. So this is how you know it's important to them because what's important to people, they will repeat. And so this is really, it's a story about imitation is the note that I left myself when I read this. But no, with Charlie's about to tell us, he's telling us a story about human nature. That's very fascinating. And if you think about like their bird's eye view that they've had in the like the finance industry, which, you know, it's been full of panics and bubbles and booms and busts, right? This is just absolutely fantastic. So Charlie Munger says, one of my favorite stories is about the little boy in Texas. The teacher asked the class, if there are nine sheep in the pen and one jumps out, how many are left? And everybody got the answer right, except this little boy who said, none of them are left. And the teacher said, you don't understand arithmetic. And he said, no teacher, you don't understand sheep. And Buffett adds on to the story by saying, it always amazes me how high IQ people mindlessly imitate. And then Buffett describes this phenomenon by this idea. He calls the three eyes. And so he says, you get what I call the natural progression, the three eyes, the innovators, the imitators, and the idiots. So skipping ahead, let's go back to this idea that they repeat over and over again. Spend a lot of time thinking, reading, formulating your own thoughts and mute the world. And so Buffett says, we do not read other people's opinions. We want to think. We want to get the facts and then think. This was such a like a mind blowing realization. Because you never know when like when you're reading something, when it just, it's going to something click or like kind of interact with maybe an idea that was previous in your mind or you didn't, you didn't, weren't necessarily like completely understood how important it was.

> **Human Intelligence and Cultural Evolution**

* Human intelligence isn't solely responsible for our survival; cultural evolution plays a crucial role.
* Brain size has decreased over the past 10,000 years, potentially due to specialization and a collective brain.
* The skills favored by evolution fall within a narrow range: not so useful they become instinct, nor so useless they're not worth learning.
* Environmental change rate influences the balance between genetic, individual, and cultural learning. In a static environment learning can be encoded in genes but in a fast environment human ability to acquire knowledge quickly is vital. 
* IQ scores may reflect cognitive abilities for navigating specific institutional environments, not generalized intelligence.

Transcript:
Dwarkesh Patel
I had this independent researcher, an internet writer called Gwern Branwen on my podcast a couple months ago. And we were discussing AI and I asked him, so his theory is very much like the brain became bigger, more intelligence. And so then I asked him like, look, if it's this simple, why did it take so long for evolution to discover intelligence in the first place? And he had this interesting answer, which is that there's a very narrow, in terms of like the signal that evolution is giving you, there's a very narrow gap between skills that are so Useful that they should like just be distilled as an instinct into your genome, and then skills that are so worthless that they're not worth learning in the first place. And so this narrow gap that's like you need that generalization ability. Like it's like not so primal that like, you know, you're not going to culturally learn hunger. You're just going to be in your genome. I don't know if that sounds like an interesting explanation or helps explain anything.

Joseph Henrich
Well, I mean, in cultural evolutionary models, there are a typical thing would be to let genes compete with individual learning to compete with cultural learning. And it turns out the rate of change of the environment affects that. So if the environment is changing slowly, then you should put it all in the genes. And if it's changing a moderate speed, then culture is the best way to go. And if it's fast, then individual learning. And the idea of the individual learning is favored because if it's changing too quickly, the previous generation doesn't know anything worth knowing because the world you're dealing With is just so much different from their world. And so it's this intermediate range. So myself and others have argued that the increase in the frequency of change during the Plyoplystocene transition 2.5 million years ago is a change that increases the value of cultural Transmission of learning from others. I'm not sure what your guest was thinking. I mean, but as our brains are not very good at solving problems, otherwise the lost European explorers could survive. And human brain size has been declining for the last 10,000 years. So we've actually been getting dumber. Fewer neurons, less computational power. Yeah.

Dwarkesh Patel
Why has brain size been declining?

Joseph Henrich
Well, the collective brain argument suggests that at a certain size, you'll begin farming off specialists. So because there's a store of knowledge in the society and we can all be generalists and learn how to do all the different skills. But at some point, it makes efficiency sense for us to specialize in different skills. In order for that to be the case, though, we have to have social agreements of some sort that allow us to trade or exchange things like that. But then once we're specializing, we don't necessarily need as large a brain because we distribute the overall brain power amongst the society. So it could be that we're becoming more of a superorganism. And you see the same thing in ants. When ants get specialized occupational casts, their individual brains shrink. Interesting.

Dwarkesh Patel
What do you make of, I think David Reich's lab had a result a month or two ago where they showed that the selective pressure on at least the European samples, which is the samples they studied, Was that there's been selection for greater intelligence over the last 10,000 years. I don't know if you saw that or what you make of that.

Joseph Henrich
Well, they didn't say anything about intelligence. They did use the polygenic score for education. Yeah. Yeah. So, but there was no education 8,000 years ago. Yeah, it's correlated. Yeah. But then the question is, is we don't know what goes into that, right? Is that actually computational software? Or, I mean, people do well in school because they stick to it and they can sit in the same place for long periods of time.

Dwarkesh Patel
I guess it would be interesting for them to sort of deduct the docility polygenic score from the education. Because we don't have a polygenic score for intelligence yet, right? Well, there are IQ.

Joseph Henrich
So there are polygenic scores for IQ. I think they actually did that one as well. Like you said, it's correlated with education. And yeah, but that doesn't have anything that the things that go into giving you an IQ, I mean, the correlation between brain size and IQ is only about, well, across populations, it's 0.24. So,'s not very big. So the other thing is, I mean, IQ is massively misunderstood. So the way to think about IQ, which has been going up over the 20th century by quite a bit. So if you rescale modern scores to 1900, it's about 70. It's called the Flynn effect. I think that those are cognitive abilities for navigating the institutional world that we've constructed. And a huge mistake would be to assume that those are the right cognitive abilities for the next century. So it'll be a different constellation. If you study, we study herders and cognitive abilities of herders in Northern Namibia. And if you're in Northern Namibia, you got to be able to move through the landscape. So being able to just pick a direction and know where you're going and not get lost is super important. So different suites of cognitive abilities are favored in different environments. This idea that there's this generalized thing applicable across all human environments just doesn't – I mean education massively increases your IQ, right?

Dwarkesh Patel
If you're uneducated, you have a totally different IQ. And then is the way in which your horsepower is directed, is that a thing that you think is basically set by the time you're an adult? Or like if somebody's 30 now and the AI thing is going to happen next and they have to like totally reorient away from knowledge work, is that a thing?

Joseph Henrich
Well, so I think it's a continuous scale. So if you look at human brains, they're developing and continuing to add new connections and stuff at least into the mid-20s. Now, there could be even more plasticity after that. Unlike chimps, we're still not totally myelinized for our whole lives. So there's definitely room. It's just there's less room.

> We organize the world into spaciotempral zones but to think that is fully reality is crazy. There is so much more ther we can’t understand because we can’t perceive it. Sometimes it is reality but a small part like an h2o molecule in the ocean is a sliver of reality or latitude and longitude being the map of reality that is simplified but not real. Either all our theories are wrong or our concepts of thiugh impose a world view that is too linear causal and ordered for the quantum world because it was trained in the classic one and doesn’t have the right first principle mental models to even understand the world. Imposing these ideas is like using dog grooming to solving quadratic equations. It’s not just shut up and calculate like insteanentslism but recognizing we have adapted to live in a narrow band but the world exists far outside that. Think of how much light exists vs what we can perceive. It’s literally impossible for us to see some of these colors. Our cognitive equipment isn’t configured that way but math can be. Math can predict nature. We have concepts like parliament which are real but also aren’t they’re only real because we believe it’s real. If we all stoped believing at a societal level it would be reduced to a useless idea. Changing the minds across society is hard. We can’t wish it a way but it is a construct of our agreements between people in society. While it exists though it is as real as a mountain based on our tacit and explicit understanding and arguments for society. There is a difference between a mountain and social institution. They are both real constructions that exists One is fully from input data the other is a projection of society as as fictitious as a novel from societal rules created like a novel is. We carve up the fundamental data which is events and interactions between events according to needs and interests at our scale. Until needs and interests introduce the refinements for the optimal degree of pluralism or proper nuance to our ontology, theory of what exist, we are left to see bookselfs as snakes not books. Our nervous system has no necessary division between books and bookselfs. We only conceive what has utility our sorting principle is just utility that is how we sort. It is the ultimate sorting function. If not useful we don’t care.

> 2. Paradigms the mindset out of which the system rules delays loops structure arises. Shared idea in minds of society the great big unstated assumptions that constitute the societies paradigm or deepest set of beliefs of how the world should function these beliefs are unstated because it is unnecessary to state them everyone knows them. Paradigm are the sources of systems that produce lower level behaviors. Our current paradigms define our system structure and differentiate it from the past. Everyone surrounds themselves with a core belief of what they think. Egyptians built Pyramids because they believed in an after life we build skyscrapers because we believe we can own land and city space is valuable. Hardest to change but this can also happen instantly Einstein and quantum mechanics. To change paradigm you prove the old paradigm is wrong and show why the new one is right. Change paradigms only once we can model the system and step outside of it

> Tradition is engrained but how to we differentiate between traditions we blindly accept and those that have been sufficiently criticized. Conspiracy theory of society is just another type of belief in a certain god controlling outcomes but instead of Zeus it’s the rich and powerful There is always a reaction to social theory that changes the way the theory is interpreted much like how someone wanting to buy or sell something effects the price in an undesired direction. The issue of the social sciences comes when we discover the unintended and unwanted consequences of our theories and actions. For see the direct and indirect consequences of social situations. We should figure out why someone acts a certain way in a certain situation that no one wants like why wars start even if no one wants them. Marx said the capitalist is as trapped as the worker what systems force behaviors that are negative as a whole. Science is as much myth making as the tales of old but now there is a second order of critical discussion and analysis of these myths. The critical or argumentative second order consequences of myth making. Scientific myths are different because the process of criticism helps them more accurately resemble reality but they are at their core no different than the myths of old in their nature and construction of what they are trying to achieve. The liberal mindset. We must build through good explanations conjecture and criticism not observation. We take what we have learned and stand on the shoulder of giants take their best guesses and stress test them. You can learn by accumulating knowledge or by conjecture and criticism of what you know We need to understand our environment so we can predict behavior otherwise we’re lost and confused. This helps define our social life we need traditions and customs to underlie how we interact socially otherwise we are lost and confused. Social norms that govern the undercurrent of all our interactions. Tradition creates order and regularities which is vital in a social world. You always need to make small adjustments take what you have then tweak if you destroy everything you’re left much worse off. Tradition is good because it makes things fit in a box and people don’t like change and tradition gives people comfort. We must uphold reason and intellectual responsibility. Correct and revolutionize but the goal of new theories is to remedy what the old theories could not not to run away from their problems We need a tradition of conjecture and criticism that is what defines our scientific myths.

With out a free market for ideas people are left scared and guessing. People who don’t feel safe to speak their minds is bad for society.

5. Cultural heritability in South Asia shows remarkable consistency over millennia, preserving core myths and the caste system despite the lack of written records.

6. Genetic data indicates a blending of ancestries in South Asia from local hunter-gatherers, early agrarian communities, and steppe pastoralists, with a freeze in genetic mixing occurring around two to three thousand years ago due to cultural shifts.

7. The caste system established in South Asia has led to a unique genetic and cultural landscape, contrasting with more fluid population dynamics in other regions like Europe.

Ie get the correlation between the 2 vars 4. If the correlation is .3 move 30% from step 2 to step 1 This helps you build on your intuitive prediction by lowering the bias when you make the prediction. Non regressive to the mean will be biased based on the evidence unless the correlation is 100% This is an approximation on statistical evidence but in some situations where tail events are really valuable and the data doesn't follow a mean distribution we need to overweight our predictions and underweight regress to the mean because there is huge value in the in linear effects.

**Author:** The Memo by Howard Marks  
**Relevance:** 8.8/10  
**Quality:** 8.6/10  
**Type:** counterpoint  

**Note:** People misjudge their resilience to panic - psychological tendencies suggest individuals will panic again in future crises

> Anticipate Panic, Prepare for Reality

Summary:
The possibility of future crises may emerge in various forms, not necessarily mirroring historical events like the Great Depression or past wars.

Initial impacts of COVID-19 were, in some respects, more severe than those at the onset of the Great Depression. Investors often misjudge their resilience to panic based on prior experiences, believing they can avoid similar reactions in future crises.

However, psychological tendencies suggest that individuals might panic again, as these reactions are ingrained in their behavior.

Hence, effective risk management should involve an asset allocation strategy that accounts for this inherent psychological vulnerability.

Furthermore, people's perceptions of risk change dramatically in times of crisis; what seems like a great opportunity when markets are thriving may provoke panic in the face of actual threats, such as a global pandemic. Thus, understanding one's psychological responses in real-time scenarios is critical for making informed financial decisions.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
What's easy to overlook is that we're not going to have another Great Depression that played out exactly like the one did in the 1930s. But we can have other things that have equally terrible consequences. The early months of COVID by some metrics were worse than the early days of the Great Depression. So it's true that we're not gonna have that again. We're not gonna have that war again. We'll have other new wars that we are underestimating today. And then for psychological risk, people tend to think that they have learned their lessons in the past. So you have an investor who says, I panicked in October of 2008, but I learned my lesson. I'm not going to do it again. And most of the evidence in behavioral finance is yes, you will. That is an ingrained part of your personality. That is your brain chemistry that caused you to panic then. And you will probably panic again in the future. The solution to that is just embrace that that's who you are and have an asset allocation that understands that. What's really important here is that when things are going well in the economy, in the market, if you were to ask someone, how would you feel if the market fell 30%, let's say, and when Things are going well, people imagine a world in which everything is the same as it is today, except stock prices are 30% cheaper. And in that world, people are like, Oh, that would be great. That'd be an opportunity. I would love it. What you overlook is that the reason the market might fall 30% is because there's a terrorist attack or a war or a recession or a pandemic. And in that context, if I said, how would you feel if the market fell 30% because there's a virus that shuts down the global economy and might kill you and your family. In that context, people are like, I don't know. I might actually panic sell myself in that situation. So it's very difficult to understand how you will respond psychologically in the trenches, in the heat of the moment.

**Note:** Priming and unconscious biases affect economic decisions before conscious processing - stereotypes shape market perceptions

> There are cues like skin, color or music that stimulate a perception of someone similar to the priming of saying ocean before asking for a cleaning product or someone would say tide. These relationships aren’t fully true but the stereotypes we learn create our perceptions of reality and send it right to the amygdala before we can have the chance of understanding and processing the event. We have an immediate response so when someone reaches in their pocket, we can think oh they’re gonna pull out a gun. Bypass logic gut reaction also linked to behaviorism which is bs. The stimuli can also be physical. Think a smile just making someone happier. Physical stimuli can create outside perceptions. Words can also stimulate behavior or opinions through priming. Framing the situation has a big effect on perception. People evacuate male hurricanes more and leads to a lower death rate even though names are picked arbitrarily because there’s a perception of authority with male names. Subtle unconscious cues. Social and physical environment shape our behavior. People are more likely to liter in areas that look worse ie broken window theory of crime. We understand and perceive emotions more through the eyes than anywhere else and psychopaths look less that the eyes than normal people. Culture shapes behavior. Cues shape our brain response right before we make a decision creating unconscious biases we don’t recognize.

**Note:** Market prices reflect psychology not value - daily changes are about who wants to buy/sell based on emotions

> Market Prices Reflect Psychology, Not Value

Summary:
Market price movements do not accurately reflect intrinsic value, particularly during crises, as they are influenced more by market psychology than fundamental changes.

Fluctuations in prices indicate shifts in the market participants' perceptions rather than true changes in value. Daily price changes primarily denote changes in who wants to buy or sell based on their emotional reactions to news rather than the actual fundamentals of the economy, company, or asset.

Significant price swings often result from the behavior of the most volatile market participants, highlighting the disconnect between perceived and intrinsic value.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
My bottom line is that markets don't assess intrinsic value from day to day, and certainly they don't do a good job during crises. Thus, market price movements don't say much about fundamentals. Even in the best of times, when investors are driven by fundamentals rather than psychology, markets show what the participants think value is rather than what value really is. Value is something the market doesn't know any more about than the average investor. And advice from the average investor obviously can't help you be an above average investor. Fundamentals, the outlook for an economy, company, or asset, don't change much from day to day. As a result, daily price changes are mostly about a. Changes in market psychology and thus b. Changes in who wants to own something or un-own something. These two statements become increasingly valid more daily prices fluctuate. Big fluctuations show that psychology is changing radically. What does the market know? January 2016. The market fluctuates at the whim of its most volatile participants. Those who are willing a. To buy at a big premium to the former price when the news is good and enthusiasm is riding high and b to sell at a big discount from the former price when the news is bad and pessimism is rampant.

**Quality:** 8.5/10  
**Type:** historical_perspective  

**Note:** History rhymes but doesn't repeat - events change but human behavioral patterns in markets remain constant

> History Rhymes, But Does Not Repeat

Summary:
Investing successfully requires patience, diversification, and an understanding that historical contexts differ significantly over time, especially regarding interests rates.

Reliance on past performance as a guide for future results can lead to disappointment due to changing economies and societal norms. While specific investment strategies from past decades may not be applicable today, the psychological behavior of investors during economic events tends to repeat.

Historical analysis should thus focus on behavioral patterns rather than concrete events or outcomes.

Recognizing that human reactions to market changes—such as recessions and bear markets—remain constant allows for a more grounded approach to investing.

The ability to predict specific economic downturns is limited; however, understanding the overall human response can inform better investment decisions. In a rapidly evolving landscape, such as the rise of AI and shifts in interest rates and debt management, it is crucial to adapt strategies based on enduring behavioral trends rather than historical investment successes that are unlikely to repeat.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
Two things I would add to what Howard just said. The first I've joked that the three most important investing skills are patience, diversification, and having your peak investing years aligned perfectly with a 40 year decline In interest rates. Those are the three things you need to do well over time. One thing I would add to this topic that I think is really important is that it becomes dangerous to use history as a perfect guide of the future. History by and large is the study of surprises. And the irony that people use the study of surprises to try to gain a map of the future causes a lot of disappointment. So it's common for people who have not experienced a rising interest rate environment to say, well, what happened in the 1970s, the last time this occurred? And they go back and say, oh, what did well? Gold did well, small caps did well, whatever it was. And they say, great, well, we do that now. And that's just not how the world works. Things adapt. It's an utterly different economy today than it was back then. Very different social standards, investing ideas, whatnot. So I think a lot of people stumble into problems when they just look back and say, well, what worked last time? And kind of like back test it from there. The world adapts in a way that doesn't allow you to do that. My solution to this is just going back historically and saying, how do people psychologically act during these events? That tends to be repeatable. The behaviors tend to be repeatable, even if the specific investing ideas are by and large not.

Speaker 1
This is what Mark Twain had in mind when he said, if in fact he said it, that history does not repeat, but it does rhyme. In other words, the events of history, the facts of history, the investments that benefited from declining interest rates, those things will not repeat. But the themes of history, and certainly, as Morgan says, human behavior will rhyme from cycle to cycle. So if you were a strict student of history and you believed that it could be extrapolated, you might go out and buy railroad stocks, which were great beneficiaries in the 1860s and 70s. But I dare say, you should say, what is the environment going to look like in the years ahead? How will investors react to that environment in the years ahead? What new investments should I be looking to to take advantage of it? Certainly not the ones that did well 150 years ago.

Speaker 2
My favorite quote here is from Voltaire, who says, history never repeats itself, but man always does. I think that's a great summary of investing history. The events never repeat, but the behaviors always do.

Speaker 3
I think this is so interesting to keep in mind right now because it does seem like we're at a time when it may be that some fundamental things in the economy could be shifting. We have AI, obviously we do have this new potential interest rate environment. You also have all of these geopolitical changes. And when people think about how much debt they can take on, how much risk they can take on, on the one hand, it seems like, okay, if everything's changing, how can anyone use anything from History to figure out how to move forward?

Speaker 2
But as both of you are saying, maybe there are these behavioral cycles, these behavioral shifts that people can look to. I think at the high level, you can say, I have no idea what's going to cause the next recession, or when it will occur. But I have a very good idea of how people respond to it, because that's really never changed. And same with bear markets and whatnot. I think the vast majority of attention in the financial world is put towards forecasting when these things are going to occur. The track record of that is very poor. I think it's just much better to have a good idea of what happens whenever they do occur, because that is something that we can learn from history. And you know that these behaviors have been happening for hundreds of years. Go back and look at how people were responding to bear markets in the 1800s and recessions in the 1800s. It's no different than it is today.

> **China's Economic Miracle**

* China's economic liberalization was not a natural occurrence but a grudging, policy-driven response to societal pressures and the state's limited capacity after famines.
* Initially, the Communist Party cautiously allowed market activities, bringing them from the black market into a quasi-legal sphere.
* While incentives to increase GDP mattered, China's economic success is often overstated and the Communist Party's role is exaggerated; it took advantage of existing entrepreneurialism and even expropriated successes. China succeeded because the people hated the failure and wanted to change the party eventually caved. The China miracle was people driven and the government hurt didn’t help it but the inertia was so strong and in systems when the inhertia is strong the policy doesn’t matter. 
* Deng Xiaoping's visit to post-war Japan revealed that Japan's partnership with America, not the Soviet Union, was the key to its economic resurgence, leading China to distance itself from the Soviet Union.

Transcript:
Dwarkesh Patel
All of that is a sort of positive, maybe positive is the wrong word, but- Policy-driven. Yeah, it's a special effort you have to make towards economic liberalization. It didn't just happen by default. People really had to push for it because the alternative story, which seems you're saying, is no, it was just that they physically could not enforce communism anymore. That's how it started, DK. So let's go look at the facts.

Stephen Kotkin
Why do you have a special economic zone? Why can't every zone have market relations? The creation of that zone had to be a proactive action. You're doing this grudgingly. This is a grudging allowance of certain behavior. So you look at the decrees. You can trade onions, but you can't trade potatoes. Okay, you can trade potatoes, but you can trade only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, not Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

Dwarkesh Patel
You can only have three employees at the Rice's, four corporations.

Stephen Kotkin
So the decrees are all grudging with very few exceptions. And the society is forcing more and more concessions onto the ideologues in the Marxist-Leninist system. So at the beginning, it's launched by the party's grudging acceptance that the society is going to rebuild and not starve through its own hard work. So they've been through a couple of famines here. I mean, really big famines. They don't have the state capacity to reimpose the system immediately in the economic sphere. So they grudgingly make concessions, very few but some in the market sphere. Gradually, that expands over time as more and more people push against the system's restrictions. And so it's a policy-driven story in part, but not as the lead. It's a policy-driven story as the following of the entrepreneurialism and the hard work of the system.

Dwarkesh Patel
But that pushback must come from, it's coming from within this. This is your thesis in uncivil society, right? Yes. It is coming from within the system because they could have, I mean, North, in 1976, they're like North Korea, literally. And North Korea still exists, right? There's no reason.

Stephen Kotkin
North Korea doesn't have the cultural revolution where it annihilates its state capacity in a Maoist frenzy in order for Mao to, in his mind, undo his rivals, unbalance and destabilize Them. Yes, they do, but they still have the mechanisms of economic control, and they have a massive black market. You got to remember that the communism doesn't have legal markets for the most part. It has restricted legal markets, again, grudgingly, household plots. But for the most part, it has a lot of illegal market activity, including in the state sector. So the state sector gets an order to produce certain numbers of large quantitative output for the military industrial sector, but it only gets allocated 25% of its ball bearings. So it has to assign its supply department on the black market to go out and find the other ball bearings that it's not assigned from central planning. So you get a massive black market in the system, not just at the level of little people in the village, but at the top level of the military industrial complex to make the system work. So when market behavior is grudgingly accepted, what that does is it brings market behavior out of the shadows into a legal or quasi-legal realm. So you're not inventing market behavior from scratch. You're surfacing it in some ways. And so party officials and industrial officials, they have market behavior in their firms to grease the system and to meet their output.

Dwarkesh Patel
I mean, I agree with their general point that how any nation gets wealthy is not by the government, but because of the thrift and entrepreneurialism and hard work of individuals. But that's also true in Western capitalist countries. In those countries, we also have a lot of stupid policies. As we sit here and speak. When we say America is a capitalist country, what we say is like the government or all the bureaucrats, they'll try to put in all these regulations and- It's only grudgingly that they Will accede to, you know, we could point to a bunch of stupid policies in America where, like, they try to outlaw the potatoes and the onions, but they could only outlaw the potatoes equivalents Things. So any capitalist society, quote unquote, is just a case where the government had to accede some amount of control. And we give credit to capitalist countries in the West for saying like, at least the government wasn't maximally stupid. Fair point, DK, fair point.

Stephen Kotkin
We often exaggerate the role of policy in all realms because we do policy ourselves or we talk to policymakers. We have a bias towards the causality of America is 25% of the global economy since 1880. We've had no income tax. We've had income tax. We've had high income tax. We've had low income tax. We've had tariffs. We've had fewer tariffs. We've had all sorts of regulations. We've had deregulation. For 150 years, more or less, we've been around 25% of global GDP, which is 5% of the population through every imaginable variety of policy regime. That doesn't mean that policy is inconsequential. It matters for a lot of players in the system. It matters for those who get the policy turned in their direction, the subsidies or the tax breaks or the taxes on their competitors or whatever it might be. A lot of gaming of the system and it does matter. But in the larger picture of things, you can't create the wealth of the united states over those 150 years that global economic dominance and you can't strangle it in the policy realm You can affect it but you can't either create or strangle it and so we have to understand in the communist sense that incentives matter we know that and so when you create incentives for Officials to increase GDP and to increase job creation, and that's how they get rewarded, you're going to get a lot of that behavior. And the party will do that, not immediately. Remember, immediately they're kind of flat on their back and they've had this gang of four and Deng Xiaoping has come back from having been purged and they're on the verge of another Potential famine. Per capita GDP under Mao is ---00 during the Cultural Revolution. ---00

**Note:** Even simple systems with simple rules have complex intractable behavior - chaos seems disordered but presents order at different level of emergence

> Modeling populations is dynamic and changes with size so it rises at this speed until it reaches this size and then it declines or stagnates. There was a term to measure non linearity. People want to discover regularities in the world and look to the areas of complexity with answers that behave linearly but we live in a world that behaves non linearly and finding linear systems is an anomaly but we only study them so were blind to the world. What happens when a populations rate of growth passes a critical point where it can no longer be stable but becomes complex and chaotic. Raising non linearity increased chaos the same system will behave very differently at different lambda values. Same system different chaos value wildly different outputs. Even in this chaos there were regular cycles and if you can prove there are cycles of 3s you realize there are cycles of every other degree and completely chaotic cycles too so what seems random is not. Can’t set up a system without the ability for that system to become chaotic at the right level. Chaos is ubiquitous stable and structured. Simple models can produce behavior that looked random but was in fact had an fine real structure that seemed indistinguishable from noise. In theoretical biology data that looked random made sense under chaos things weren’t looked at as static but dynamic systems. The world is apparently random but can actually be described by very simple models and these models transcend fields unified world truths. Simple systems do not have simple properties

> Artificial life is the idea that the laws of life are not through analysis like conventional biology but understanding. Life by synthesis putting simple pieces of the life puzzle together to create characteristics. Life is not matter but an organization of that matter. The laws of life must be laws of dynamic form regardless of being carbon based life forms. Ie life on other planners can be life without any of the biological similarities essence of life only when we view life as what it could be will we understand life as it truly is. While organizations build top down life comes bottom up with key pieces being formed through simplicity but very complex things can come out of very few and simple building blocks. Why due to entropy at a small scale things are trending towards chaos while at a larger scale things are able to former high levels of order such as stars and galaxies low level disorder leading to an emergent property of order. Connectionism the power lies in the connections very simple initiatial states like neurons for connections of subroutines that create the basis for knowledge complex outcomes from simple inputs. So you can build on old connectors building sustaining knowledge or do the equivalent of ripping connections out which is disruptive learning. Local vs global maximums.

> This book is generally about incentive misalignment and hubris. The high modernist approach assumes its correct and its critics are stupid, but it misses all the nuance. It has the same issue the nail factory had when it made millions of tiny unusable nails. Likewise, when you are optimizing for one thing you get lost in the local system knowledge that you need. If you want a sherpa to help you climb a mountain, you would like them to have experience on this mountain not other mountains. Because all answers are situation dependent. The best path for the climb is different in the heat, cold, rain, snow, ect. A high modernist approach might say this is the best way, but the metis of the local sees this is an older group and realizes the “best” way will be 2x harder and likely take longer. Complexity is often rejected due to lack of order, but this is the opposite of the truth. Order is chaos and complexity is deep order. The beautiful scientific forests were monocrop fragility disasters that destroyed ecosystems while the original disordered forest was actually a complex ecosystem that needed predators and pray parasites and pests. There is no greater danger in knowing youre right because at this point you are most likely wrong. Things are not infinitely reducable and eventually the nuance of a usecase is lost. A street is not meant for living or working or eatings or socializing. It is for all of those things. When a street becomes only about one of those its value disintegrates.

The nose wasn’t invented for people to wear glasses. Were always looking for the one true thing that explains the universe since Thales. Humans have the desire to think there is one answer. We are looking for a simple fundamental unifying theory but this might be wrong. Likewise we can see the world in a deep simple way.

Also viewed information processing at computation. Bf skinner argued language was based on past stimulus responses such that saying John was likely to be followed by kiss ect. This idea was refuted by Noam Chomsky who instead argued we learned basics of language and grammar from which we had rules to think and form sentences thinking was counter to behaviorism. The idea that language was based on grammatical systems that had a hierarchy of rules and with different hierarchy at different levels you got different language and that our form of language was based on very complex grammar constructions that our minds were very complex forms of Turing machines because that’s what was needed to execute human grammar

Systems that are aperiodic apst repeat themselves but never truly do in the same time frame scale and process.

For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system.

> Trust and Trade: The Power of Shared Stories

Summary:
Trust is the foundation of trade, particularly when dealing with strangers.

Unlike other species, humans developed intersubjective realities—shared beliefs and stories—that foster trust and coordination, enabling trade and societal cooperation. Symbols, such as religious icons or distinctive attire, serve as markers of shared beliefs, facilitating trust among individuals who may not know each other.

Money exemplifies this concept as it is a successful story that everyone believes in, allowing transactions to occur on a global scale despite differing political factions.

The qualitative nature of stories, whether they uplift or cause harm, also determines their impact on society.

Thus, the efficacy of shared stories in shaping human interaction and economic systems underscores the intricate relationship between belief, trust, and cooperation.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Now, how do you exchange or trade flint with people you don't really know, people from another band? You don't see chimpanzees do it. You don't see evidence for that with Neanderthals. We think about trade as something natural. Oh, of course, it's good for me. It's good for you. Let's trade. If that was so, why is it that no other animal except Homo sapiens trades? Because interest is not enough. You need trust. In order to trade with somebody, you need to trust them. Now, the biggest question in trade, in much of human history, is how do you trust strangers? It's easy to trust your own band members, family, friends. How do you trust strangers? And this is where stories come. Stories are a technology to create trust between strangers. I believe in this big spirit, you believe in the same spirit. I don't know you personally, but because we both believe in the same spirit, I trust you. And how do I know that you believe in the same spirit as me? Maybe you have some kind of distinctive headgear that indicates that you believe in the same spirit as me. So now if you log on the streets of New York, you will see it. People going with different funny hats and the hats telling like two Jews that never met in their life, they immediately know, oh, he's also Jewish. Why? Because he has the same funny hat that I'm wearing. So I can trust him or her, which means that there is a basis also for economic cooperation. And it's no wonder that you look at the American dollar, it's not the Stone Age, it's also the modern era. You look at the US dollar, what's written on it in God with trust. There is no dollar without some God or some mythology. So like in China, they don't have God, so they have Chairman Mao on all their M&B. And in Mao we trust. He's the ancestral spirit. And if I trust Mao and you trust Mao, we can cooperate.

Speaker 2
That's what's so fascinating about these stories. You have this concept of the difference between subjective reality and intersubjective reality. And I think that's a really important differentiation. So subjective reality would be something that a reality inside of my own head as an individual. But what Homo sapiens does, what we do as humans is we create these intersubjective realities, these stories that we share and we all believe collectively together and we use these To coordinate on things. And when you say stories, I just want to make this clear, you're not just talking about mythologies, fairy tales, this type of thing. You think of like a corporation is a story. Money, as you were talking about earlier in the episode, is also a story. Why? Because it's an intersubjective reality. We all believe the dollar is valued at whatever. CPI, the price I can purchase this basket of goods for. Because, why?

Speaker 1
We all believe it. You can't eat or drink a dollar. There is nothing useful you can do with it. But as long as everybody trusts it, you can go to a complete stranger and give them a dollar bill and get a piece of bread or an apple that you can eat. And you look at the United States today, and one of the last stories that still connects everybody is the story of money. Democrats and Republicans can hardly agree about anything, but they still use the same money. And they still use the same price system. They can still agree on the price of a gallon of gasoline. They don't even think about questioning it.

Speaker 2
It's not like one party's like, we're going to create our own, you know, unit and it's going to be called...

Speaker 1
And we can't. What would happen if this would be the case? I mean, then we really see societal collapse. If people can no longer trust even the, and in many ways, money is the most successful story ever told because it's the one story that almost everybody believes and agree on. And if this goes, then it's really chaos.

Speaker 3
So there's two aspects of a good story that I want to get your take on. One is scale. One reason why money is such a good story is because it scales.

Speaker 1
Successful. I mean, good or not depends what you do with it, but it is very successful.

Speaker 3
Right. Very successful, yes. And so one aspect, one successful aspect is how far can the scale. If you take a dollar to basically any country in the world, you can generally trade it for what it's worth. Successful story. And then there's also an idea of how aligned with truth that story may or may not be. Perhaps the Constitution of the United States is a story that's more aligned with reality than a religious document. How do you think about like the qualitative nature of like whether these stories are good or not?

Speaker 1
You know the basic question is whether the consequences are harmful. Whether it creates more misery and suffering and violence in the world, the story, or whether the story helps us to alleviate suffering. So again, you think about a religious story. It can be used for both purposes. You can use religious ideals and mythologies in stories about Jesus in order to inspire people to be more compassionate, to donate to charity, to build a hospital. And then it doesn't matter if what they tell you about Jesus is true or not, or if the image, the portrait of Jesus that hangs in your house, whether it's a true liking of the actual man who Lived in the Galilee, like 2000 years ago, or no, doesn't matter. If it inspires you to help people, then it's a good story. But you can use exactly the same story to start a religious war, to persecute minorities, to start an inquisition, a witch hunt. And then that's terrible. And the story can go, usually the story can go both ways.

**Note:** Organizational energy - companies converge on room temperature equilibrium. Best leaders are exothermic, injecting heat. Everyone allowed to conserve energy locally

> Ignite Passion, Protect Innovation

Summary:
Companies often operate at a 'room temperature' equilibrium, where energy conservation leads to stagnation.

Effective leaders, often exothermic individuals, energize their teams and challenge the status quo, introducing heat into the business. These leaders not only foster a culture of innovation but also protect their passionate individuals from the political machinations that stifle progress.

Founders inherently possess the drive to inject energy into their organizations, demanding that teams focus on a common mission, especially more essential during chaotic times.

Political dynamics in organizations can lead up to 60% of employees' time being wasted on political maneuvering, contrary to the best companies where it is only around 20%.

Protecting innovative individuals requires promoting their strengths and bypassing conventional career ladders based on seniority, instead prioritizing merit. Success lies in creating an environment that celebrates speed and agility, focusing on high merit with low ego, thereby facilitating true innovation and progress. Founders and change agents must find a delicate balance between maintaining motivation and harnessing energy while not allowing political resistance to undermine their mission.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
I think what happens in most companies is they converge on, let's go with temperature. I think companies run at room temperature because that's the entropic equilibrium of temperature. That's not a problem if everyone else does it too. So in room temperature, everything is just soul. Then there's people who inject heat into businesses. Brilliant product managers, brilliant people in any job do this. They're dissatisfied with status quo. They pump energy. The best leaders are literally exothermic. They are just like this complete wellspring of heat into the system. Every atom jiggles faster around them. There's no chance for stasis. Nothing is frozen over time. However, people mean well, but they fight it. They do because everyone's allowed to try to conserve energy. Everyone's allowed to be intelligent actor in the local incentive system. And there's a lot of heat in a project. Everyone go faster, do this better. And the best way out of it is to just politic that person away, then the people will do it. At least someone will do it in a large team. And if that works, then those people are gone. And then room temperature prevails. Founders are not room temperature people by definition. The act of starting a company is you're trying to inject heat into planet Earth. You're trying to do something like fighting against entropy. You're trying to make something better or something different. So I think founders are recruited out of a set of exothermic people to begin with. Here's the thing that founders end up doing. Not just are they injecting heat from the top into the whole thing, they also protect the others. When things are going well, they make the politicking against them not work. So if you do this well, I have a company that many of my reports, I think almost all of them, are the founders of the company. I literally collect them. During COVID, I had a lot of executive turnover. I went to the founders' Slack channel, which is people who over the years brought into Shopify for talent acquisitions and so on, and said, hey, we're in a crazy time and you all have been Responsible for people's livelihoods before, and therefore you know what that's like and who can do what. Let's go. Let's dance. And I think this is a real thing. Companies have a clock speed. Companies have a temperature. And it's just powerful to preserve it. And then it's powerful to be able to use all that energy and direct it into a mission where you can re-derive from first principles what the next best step is on this mission, especially During times where the fog of war has settled and the map is not quite clear, the mission gives you a direction and you need to figure out the best path through it. In a game of perfect information, in a time of perfect information, maybe this is sort of a 2017, 18, 19 era. This is actually not ideal for companies. I think you actually want potentially lack of heat in the system, lack of jiggly atoms, pick your metaphor here, is not fatal because actually the plans will work because the plans are Not going to be invalidated by a changing environment. And therefore, it's way simpler to lead a company this way. All these stories about hire good people and get out of their way actually work, but they work accidentally because everyone's just following the plan. The plan is the thing that's telling people what to do, not the CEO.

Speaker 2
Especially interested because it resonates so much with my own experience. The act of protecting the exothermic hot people seems like where the rubber really meets the road here in terms of what your job is. Obviously, you got to get them in the seats in the first place. You talk about that too, but you can probably identify those people, even if it's just those that have been founders, like you said. Can you tactically tell me how you have protected those people and the steps that you've taken to not let the political machine oust them from the system and reject the organ?

Speaker 1
Look, the difference between the best companies in the world and the worst company of the world is probably that humans are political creatures. And the best companies in the world, people spend up to 20% of the time on politics, and then most companies is up to 60%. There's a very small margin in which you can operate. You can harness politics, too. It can be good, it can be bad. It's not even all that. But it usually means that people have a different hierarchy of goals than the company itself. So the top goal is not the mission of a company. It's your own career or something like this. How do you protect people? Well, you just make the exothermic thing work. That's what you promote. Again, I pick people from individual crafter roles and put them in charge of large hundreds of people departments after they ran a code red. For me, that just really worked. And they have the abilities to do this. But they skipped many, many rungs that other people think they should have really passed through on the ladder of a career. And I just don't agree with that. And the people that really, really need this to be all just so and everything being seniority based, I suppose. I think there's a lot of great companies out there that are structured so and I don't have a product that they want to buy in terms of a way to think of a career. I think of merit. And I'm actually not arguing in favor here of a brilliant jerk and keeping them and building because I think that's actually can end up being toxic. I think also like the ego to merit ratio has to be enormous to just bother with people, I think. Life's too short to surround yourself with mean energy vampires like that. That's not a good idea. So high merit to ego ratio is important. Some people are incredibly good at what they do, and they are allowed to be self-confident about them. I know some people misconstrue this as arrogance, but it's arrogance if you're no good at thing. If you're actually good at a thing, you're just communicating it. And people might not like that, but that's just aesthetics at this point. It's a complicated balance and you have to figure it out. The second way is malice in behavior amount. So there's a code of conduct, minimum requirements. I think that's a valuable thing to just break up in this context. So how do you protect them? Well, you do. You say, hey, we have a company built for these type of people and we celebrate going fast and it's what this place is all about.

Speaker 2
Can you have a team full of hot people, of exotropic people, or do you need some room temperature people no matter what?

Speaker 1
I don't think it's possible to try that at any kind of scale just because it's just not that common. But I think, quote, absolutely. I think that's the story of the greatest agents of change. I'm sure the founding fathers had no passive players in them o...

Systems are described by interactions with other systems. Quantum mechanics is measured as the interaction between 2 systems or the correlation of the information between 2 systems. Description of system is summary of all past interactions to predict future ones. Relevant info is finite and we can always learn more about systems.

Hell go to the Air Force to change regulations that he thinks don’t make sense. Views design and manufacture as the same. Walks the line wants efficiency in both places. Believes designing local is key to keep iterating. Puts engineers on the factory line so they see the result of their design. He got the first model s off the line didn’t like it and fired the 3 heads of design. Getting the root of the problem and he did it within a week acting quickly. He’s very hardcore. Greatness is application of principles over decades. His success came from challenging his people to do the near impossible which at first almost led to failure but eventually led to success.

Now, another thing that Elon's going to repeat, and he learns this through pain, through the capacity to keep going through immense amounts of pain, is if your design is hard to manufacture In large numbers, then your design is flawed. He says, design is not just about aesthetics. The true industrial design must connect the looks of a product to its engineering. There's actually a great quote about design from Steve Jobs in this book that I think is exactly the way Elon thinks about it.

> Understanding the Value of Liquidity Across Cycles

Summary:
Appreciating the foundational work of pioneers like Michael Milken is essential for contextualizing today’s private equity landscape, especially for younger professionals who may lack awareness of past nuances.

A critical approach to capital structure emphasizes the importance of liquidity during downturns over maximizing leverage during upswings, advocating for low leverage to avoid detrimental decision-making influenced by recency bias. Cyclicality plays a significant role in evaluating the cash flows and valuations of businesses, necessitating a long-term perspective that transcends short-term performance metrics.

Proactively seizing opportunities during crises can lead to substantial returns on investment, with ample prepared capital serving as a critical advantage for effective deal-making in uncertain environments.

Why do you read Predator's Ball every January?

Speaker 2
I think that people our age don't have a full enough appreciation for what Michael Milken both built and set into effect in terms of his creation, in terms of high yield securities, spawned The ability for private equity to exist at the speed, size and scale that it is today. And we always get disappointed when we interview younger people and we ask about that time period and they look at us like blankly. And I think a lot of the thoughtfulness of that era, and obviously there were excesses too, but a lot of the thoughtfulness is lost amongst people in their 30s and 40s today. And I think it's important to reread that and appreciate it. And since Byron, you had people in that book who were our age, who built some of the most incredible, successful companies on earth when they were even less experienced than we were at The time with far less of a roadmap.

Speaker 3
We stand on the shoulders of those giants and benefit from that. They didn't have that. You mentioned how pioneering they were. What is your philosophy of cap structure? Because so much of what Milken did was, I guess, create the opportunity to have a philosophy of cap structure in the first place. You just had to go all the way to the 30,000 foot view on capital structure. How would you sum it up?

Speaker 2
I think I would sum it up in terms of liquidity in downside scenarios is always worth more to you over a longer period of time than max leverage is in an upside scenario. And what does that mean for us? That means entering with low leverage. That means never maxing out firstly in debt capacity. On the downside case, firstly in debt is by far the easiest thing to raise, particularly if you have baskets and caps and availability for it. And when Microsoft Excel maximum leverage works wonders in real life, it can lead to poor decision-making and zeros, both of which we actively try to avoid.

Speaker 3
You've said cycles so many times, maybe it's just an opportunity to ask what that means to you. Is that just variance in demand for lots of different reasons? If you had to think about what is a cycle, why do you care so much about cycles? How would you describe it?

Speaker 2
Yeah, I think a couple of thoughts on cyclicality. One is private equity, at least in the U.S., has a tendency towards recency bias, both in terms of what they think the underlying cash flows of a business is. The distribution of outcomes tends to skew towards what's focused a lot on the last 12 months and less so on three years ago in terms of underlying earnings, as well as what is the right Multiple for this business. It's the last 12 deals have traded at X, so it's probably close to X. I think both those things ignore that, at least in our world, where everything we touch touches the US consumer, there's cyclical elements to both those things, both in terms of the Underlying cash flow and what the appropriate market multiple for these businesses is. And so we like to diligence not only the earning streams over cycles, but also the valuation across cycles. The other reason why we're so focused on cyclicality and probably because our portfolio was so in the eye of the storm of COVID is never waste a good crisis. Some of our best deals were done in April of 2020 in the depths of the COVID crisis and God bless undrawn debt financing and committed equity capital. But we have the luxury of being able to go on offense at those times. And that's where, at least in our experience, you can really generate the excess return per unit of risk you're taking. And we certainly wouldn't be able to do that in 2015 as much as we can in 2024 because we didn't have a fund back then. We didn't have committed capital. We probably weren't able to get the size of undrawn committed debt facilities as well as obviously equity as we can today. But today with 2.3 billion of AUM, tons of undrawn capital, both in the fund and the portfolio level through DLOX development lines of credit and that sort of thing, shame on us if we can't

> The Impact of CEO Role on Company's Direction

Summary:
The former senior level executive at Amazon became a key figure in the company.

Speculation suggests that Bill's shift from CEO to chief software architect might have influenced Microsoft's direction post the antitrust challenges. The shift possibly affected the company by limiting Bill's engagement with OEM partners, enterprises, and customers, allowing for issues like the longhorn black home disaster to occur due to a focus on technical decisions without considering broader feedback and strategic implications.

Transcript:

Yeah. Yep. He went to Amazon. He was like a named top senior level executive at Amazon for a long time. Wow. You know, and then the other thing about this whole process that this is purely my own speculation, like nobody said this, but just as I've been thinking and reflecting on how seminal A moment the antitrust stuff was to Microsoft after the height of their consumer power right beforehand, I think this might be a case where Bill no longer being CEO and just being chief Software architect really impacted this process. When you're a CEO, you have to engage with your OEM partners. You have to engage with enterprises. You have to engage with customers. And not that it's all Bill's fault by any means, but this longhorn black home disaster, that as you say, was a case of getting high on your own supply within the company.

> Learning from Military History and the Great Captains for Business Success

Summary:
The key insight is that war consists of accidents and commanders should pay attention to details to exploit these accidents, often referred to as luck but actually a sign of genius.

Success in battle can be determined by the smallest circumstances. Learning to be a great general, or in entrepreneurship, involves studying military history and the battles of great captains for acquiring knowledge of grand principles.

There are no fixed rules, as everything depends on an individual's character.

The principles of warfare are learned from studying great captains like Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar, whose campaigns provide a comprehensive guide to the art of war.

These principles are valuable for both defensive and offensive warfare.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And this is part of the reason why war consists of nothing but accidents, and that a commander should never overlook anything that might enable him to exploit these accidents. The vulgar call this luck, but in fact, is a characteristic of genius back to this idea of paying attention to the tiniest details. Sometimes a single battle decides everything. And sometimes too, the slightest circumstance decides the battle. Little things are big things is how I would summarize what he's saying there. This he's talking about how do you learn how to be a great general, really what he's saying here. I wrote same with entrepreneurship. Knowledge of the grand principles of warfare can be acquired only through the study of military history and of battles of the great captains and through experience. So you and I are doing this for business, right? There are no precise determinant rules. Everything depends on the character that nature has bestowed on the individual. That is so good. Knowledge of the grand principles of warfare can be acquired only through the study of military history and of the battles of the great captains and through experience. Obviously, you and I using that for metaphor. There are no precise determinant rules. Everything depends on the character that nature has bestowed on the individual. People are power law and the best ones can change everything. And then he describes his personal historical curriculum. The principles of warfare are those which guided the great captains whose high deeds history has transmitted to us. Alexander Hannibal Caesar names a bunch of other ones, Frederick the Great, the history of their 83 campaigns would constitute a complete treatise on the art of war. The principles that must be followed in defensive and offensive warfare would flow from it as from a common source. And so then he talks about not only is he learning from these people, but they learn from each other.

Transcript:
Alex Hutchinson
And so in some of the papers, they call it the... I'm not even sure how to pronounce this. I'm going to go with the Wundt curve, although I think in Vienna they would probably say the Wundt curve. There's a famous German psychologist, pioneering German psychologist in the 1800s named Wilhelm Wundt. And he proposed this idea, this sort of stimulus response curve that's a very general phenomenon where it's like, for any given stimulus, if it's weak, we don't really find it very interesting. As it gets stronger, we find it more and more compelling. But if it gets too strong, understandably, we're like, yeah, we don't like that anymore. And so for uncertainty, there's a lot of evidence that this is the case, even with like, you can take like eight month old babies and show them like patterns of toys coming out of a box or Whatever. And if it's super predictable, it's always the same toy. They're like, oh, boring. And you can track their gaze to see if they're interested. And if it's super unpredictable, it's like always something different. They find that boring. But if there's some sort of regularity, it's not predictable, but it's not crazy. And you sort of feel like you could figure out the pattern. That's what we tend to find interesting. That's what this Vunt curve is about. It's like an upside down you. You want to be in that sweet spot where it's like, I don't know what's going to happen next but it's not just gibberish it's like you know this applies to music for example they've done Analyses it's like if music is super predictable this is why i want you know after the age of 10 we don't find mary had a little lamb that interesting if it's super predictable we don't Find it all that compelling but if it's just random tones we don't find that compelling either. There's a sweet spot, but that sweet spot depends on our experience too. So if you spend a lot of time listening to music or playing music or studying music, you start to prefer more and more complex and less predictable music because you're getting better At predicting what comes next.

The anxiety of an event we fear death but it’s nothing to us. Learning to die or fear death is irrelevant because it’s not part of our lives experience. We must look death in the face. Everyday is no different than one day. We can experience all the happiness in a lifetime in a day. It’s wrong to live under a constraint. The fact you must die should focus you on what you can control your life. We experience dying but not our death. Death seems bad because of what it takes away from us. Prospect of loss is what seems bad but loss in it of itself. Coward dies 1000 times over. The wise man mediates on life not death. Because we only see the world through our eyes and can’t see ourselves as dead we’re immortal. When we die we lose our present moment. Were the sum of past experience and future hope. We’d rather in society escape death and pretend it doesn’t exist rather than live accept it and integrate what those people say into our lives so they live through us and remember their love. We reject and are a society intolerant of death and leave dying to doctors in hospitals it’s not something that happens in normal society. We struggle to deal with death alot more than older people. Sorrow is natural and if we died we’d want people to move on so we should too. Although sorrows comes from outside it’s up to us how we receive them is up to us we must bear and master them stoic idea. Absence is a large presence in our lives that’s why bereavement is so hard. We can forget and move on but it never fully leaves us. We must accept the opportunity of loss as the contract we make with life.

Speaker 1
The biggest piece of overarching advice that I give is that you will not be the same person who you were one year ago. And that is all across the board. It's the way you use email. It's the way that you run a meeting. It's you know, your goals for yourself, what you believe your strengths and your weaknesses to be. And because all of my clients are running these companies that are changing so quickly, they never really get the footing of feeling like they're doing something really well for a long Period of time. And I think that's like one of the hard things about the founders. And I feel like you can really relate to this being a business owner is that you know, when you have a regular job, the better you get at that job, the easier the job becomes because you know How to do it. And with being a founder, I call it the reverse incentive learning curve where actually the better you get at your job, the harder your job becomes because you're just creating more Complexity for yourself. And so with my clients, I really say get used to it. It's going to always feel like the rug is getting pulled underneath you. And that's a good thing because if you ever feel like you know exactly what's going on and you've done it, then your company isn't growing any longer and you're not solving new challenges, Not pushing yourself. And so I'll really actively use that language them while I'll be like, okay, feels like we're moving into a new era. You know, this was you 1.0 now this is you 2.0 or 3.0 wherever we are. And so I do a lot of kind of reflecting about how they've grown where I'll say, hey, let's pause. Let's think about how you would have handled this a year ago versus now and get them to actively accept and acknowledge that they are these highly changeable creatures. And so this is actually what I'm writing my next book about. But my big thesis is that in this new world that we live in, IQ doesn't really matter. Of course, we have to clear some certain bar of intelligence, but what really matters is your ability to adapt and change, which I'm calling AQ. That's actually what matters. You know, I read somewhere that it used to be that people would have six jobs over the course of their lifetime. And now it's projected that Gen Z will have 15 jobs across five industries, you know, like they're going to change industries multiple times. They're going to live in multiple houses, different cities.

> If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.  The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.  Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.

> The Business Models of Blockchains & Comparing Blockchains to Apple

Key takeaways:
- Nielsen's law states that every year, consumer bandwidth grows by 50%
- Exponential growth of block space supply could lead to infinite supply and congestion fees going to zero
- Contention is always present and derives from market inefficiencies that can be arbitrashed out
- Blockchains sell blocks as their product

Transcript:
Speaker 1
But we live in an exponential world with technology. We live in a world where supply grows exponentially. There's this equivalent of more lawful bandwidth, which is called Nielsen's law. Nielsen's law says that every year, consumer bandwidth grows by 50%. And so if we have this exponential growth of block space supply, then we might essentially have infinite supply and the congestion fees will go to zero. Whereas contention is something that's kind of always there. It's latent. It derives from these market inefficiencies that can be arbitrashed out. And so now we have these two business models. If one of them fails, it's maybe okay because the other business model comes in.

Speaker 3
That's really fascinating that business model idea, Justin, because one thing we've tried to reinforce on bankless and people are trying to understand blockchains is what products do blockchains produce. We always say this. Blockchains sell blocks. That's the product that they actually sell, right?

Speaker 2
Blockchains sell blocks. Yeah.

Speaker 3
And we've compared it to sort of like Apple, right? So the value of an iPhone is worth more than sort of a commodity phone. You could see that in the profit margin. So Apple sells really good phones. And so they're able to charge a premium. That's why there's a premium on Ethereum block space. But what's also interesting is this idea of a second business model here. If you notice a company like Apple, their first business model is they sell the phone. They sell the hardware. They make a thousand dollars a phone. That's fantastic.

> The Gradual Path to AGI: Exponential Intelligence Growth

Summary:
AGI represents a smooth, exponential advancement in artificial intelligence rather than a distinct leap.

As AI evolves, it improves gradually and can outperform human intelligence in various fields, including creativity and complex problem-solving. AGI can control various tools and operate independently, deploying numerous instances simultaneously, learning and acting much faster than humans.

While some predict a rapid technological singularity following the emergence of superintelligent AI, this perspective overlooks the nuanced and layered growth of intelligence, suggesting instead that improvements will build upon past breakthroughs, leading to incremental yet significant advancements.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
There's no point at which you pass the threshold and you're like, oh my God, we're doing a totally new type of computation and new. And so I feel that way about AGI. Like there's just a smooth exponential. And like, if, if by AGI, you mean like, like AI is getting better and better and like gradually it's going to do more and more of what humans do until it's going to be smarter than humans. And then it's going to get smarter even from there. Then, then yes, I believe in AGI. If, but if, if, if AGI is some discrete or separate thing, which is the way people often talk about it, then it's, it's kind of a meaningless buzzword. Yeah.

Speaker 3
And to me, it's just sort of a platonic form of a powerful AI, exactly how you define it. I mean, you define it very nicely. So on the intelligence axis, it's just on pure intelligence, it's smarter than a Nobel prize winner, as you described, across most relevant disciplines. So, okay, that's just intelligence. So it's both in creativity and be able to generate new ideas, all that kind of stuff in every discipline, Nobel prize winner. Okay. In their prime. It can use every modality. So this kind of self-explanatory, but just operate across all the modalities of the world. It can go off for many hours, days and weeks to do tasks and do its own sort of detailed planning and only ask you help when it's needed. It can use, this is actually kind of interesting. I think in the essay you said, I mean, again, it's a bet that it's not going to be embodied, but it can control embodied tools. So it can control tools, robots, laboratory equipment. The resource used to train it can then be repurposed to run millions of copies of it. And each of those copies would be independent that can do their own independent work. So you can do the cloning of the intelligence. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1
I mean, you, you might imagine from outside the field that like, there's only one of these, right. That like you made it, you've only made one, but the truth is that like the scale up is very quick. Like we, we do this today, we make a model and then we deploy thousands, maybe tens of thousands of instances of it. I think by the time, you know, certainly within two to three years, whether we have these super powerful AIs or not, clusters are going to get to the size where you'll be able to deploy Millions of these and they'll be, you know, faster than humans. And so if your picture is, oh, we'll have one and it'll take a while to make them.

Speaker 3
My point there was, no, actually you have millions of them right away. And in general, they can learn and act 10 to 100 times faster than humans. So that's a really nice definition of powerful AI. Okay, so that, but you also write that clearly such an entity would be capable of solving very difficult problems very fast, but it is not trivial to figure out how fast. Two extreme positions both seem false to me. So the singularity is on the one extreme and the opposite on the other extreme.

Speaker 1
Can you describe each of the extremes? Yeah. And why? So yeah, let's describe the extreme. So like one extreme would be, well, look, if we look at kind of evolutionary history, like there was this big acceleration where for hundreds of thousands of years, we just had like, You know, single-celled organisms and then we had mammals and then we had apes. And then that quickly turned to humans. Humans quickly built industrial civilization. And so this is going to keep speeding up. And there's no ceiling at the human level. Once models get much, much smarter than humans, they'll get really good at building the next models. And you know, if you write down like a simple differential equation, like this is an exponential. And so what's, what's going to happen is that models will build faster models, models will build faster models. And those models will build, you know, nanobots that can like take over the world and produce much more energy than you could produce otherwise. And so if you just kind of like solve this abstract differential equation, then like five days after we, you know, we build the first AI that's more powerful than humans, then, then, You know, like the world will be filled with these AIs and every possible technology that could be invented, like will be invented. I'm caricaturing this a little bit. But I, you know, I think that's one extreme. And the reason that I think that's not the case is that one, I think they just neglect like the laws of physics. Like it's only possible to do things so fast in the physical world. Like some of those loops go through, you know, producing faster hardware. Um, uh, it takes a long time to produce faster hardware. Things take a long time. There's this issue of complexity. Like, I think no matter how smart you are, like, you know, people talk about, oh, we can make models of biological systems that'll do everything, the biological systems. Look, I think computational modeling can do a lot. I did a lot of computational modeling when I worked in biology, but like, just, there are a lot of things that you can't predict how they're, you know, they're, they're complex enough That like just iterating, just running the experiment is going to beat any modeling, no matter how smart the system doing the modeling is.

Speaker 3
Or even if it's not interacting with the physical world, just the modeling is going to be hard.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I think, well, the modeling is going to be hard and getting the model to, to, to, to match the physical world is going to be. All right. So he does have to interrupt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Verify. But it's just, you know, you just look at even the simplest problems. Like, you know, I think I talk about, like, you know, the three-body problem or simple chaotic prediction, like, you know, or like predicting the economy. It's really hard to predict the economy two years out.

> You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.

It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.

The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.

> The source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target.

It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winnning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.

> What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be [independent-minded](http://paulgraham.com/think.html) to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well.

Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out.

**Type:** definition  

**Note:** Perfect explanation of two ways work compounds - directly and through learning, with audience example

> Are there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.

There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.

**Note:** 'Do things that don't scale' principle showing how initial effort kicks off exponential growth

> In the startup world, the name for this principle is "do things that don't scale." If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get.

There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase "your work" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio.

> The Framework for Evaluating New Skills and Initiatives: Uncapped Upside and Zero Downside

Key takeaways:
- When evaluating potential activities to spend time on, they should have uncapped upside and a worst-case scenario of building a transferable skill.
- Writing on Twitter is a good example of an activity with potential exponential upside and low downside risk.
- Playing a game with both exponential upside and zero downside can help build transferable skills that can be reapplied later.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
How I think about building new skills and taking on new initiatives right now is a framework from Tim Ferriss, which is when you're evaluating something to potentially spend your time on, it should have two things. It should have in some way uncapped upside such that if you do it, there's a chance of a lottery outcome, whatever you decide that lottery outcome is, but it's some kind of exponential upside. And the downside worst case is that you build a skill that then you could reapply elsewhere. And so I look at writing on Twitter as the perfect example of this. The upside is every single time you publish a tweet, it could go viral. Anyone on the world could see it, Elon Musk could see it, you could reach the most powerful people in the world. So if you publish 100 tweets, 200, 500, 1000, you're putting all those lottery tickets on goal, or in your pocket, worst case, you write 100 tweets for 100 days and you become a little bit better of a writer and no one reads them at all. And so I think for anyone thinking of how am I, what am I leveling up on right now? Make sure you're playing a game that has both exponential upside and zero downside because you would build a skill that then you could reapply later.

> Nothing exists within a vacuum.  Except of course outer space, which basically a vacuum and we all exist within it, so to us everything exists in a vacuum.  Semantics, and aliens, aside we do not exist alone, but as a vast part of a larger cosmos.  It becomes easy to lose sight of our rather small place in the infinitely vast universe, but we are a direct result of it.  The earth was formed by a small subset of elements from the wider universe using simple rules to create life, consciousness, and sentience from empty space in a vacuum.  This is essence and power of systems.  Using self organization, resilience, and hierarchy, systems create a whole much greater than the sum of its parts.   This is a result of economies of scales within systems.  True understanding comes at the systems level.  You cannot define a word by its definition says that to truly understand something one needs to understand that concept in relation to other concepts not in relation to itself.  A mark of fundamental understanding is how well can we fit this new object into the already existing systems of our world.  A systems view takes a wholistic approach to a concept and allows us to conceptualize the wider universe instead of focusing on a specific area.  Systems exist in a simplified form, think a pendulum rocking from side to side in synchrony, or complex form, think a pendulum rocking side to side for hours changing its course due to friction.  Here we dive into what are systems, how they manifest in the world, why we should try to view the world at a system not a point level, the complexity they involve and more.

Number two, you have to have a deep interest in it. And number three, it offers the scope to do great work. In practice, you don't have to worry much about the third criteria. All you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and a great interest in. And right away, we get to one of Paul's first footnotes. He says doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. That's something he's going to repeat many times in different ways throughout the essays. Just keep that in mind. There's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree and it's often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focus on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing and leave it to the future generations to say if you succeeded. Back to the top of the essay, he left off. He says, all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and a great interest in. That sounds straightforward, but it is often quite difficult. When you're young, you don't know what you're good at. And some kinds of work that you end up doing may not even exist yet. It's funny because that's the same advice I went and I went and talked to the career day at my daughter's school when she was in fourth grade. And I don't think the teachers liked it very much because I started the conversation with, don't worry about what your parents or your teachers think. Just find out what you're naturally interested in and become a learning machine. And so in my own way, I told a bunch of nine year olds that because I was like, listen, when I was your age, there was no such thing as podcasting. It didn't even exist. Back to what Paul said, the way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess, but pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that is fine. And this is an idea that you and I have talked about multiple times. You see it in these biographies over and over again, the act of finding your life's work for an entrepreneur usually requires that you're going to have to start more than one business. I'd have to go back to the episodes to see if I could even find somebody that got it right the first time. Maybe I think the closest example of this might be Mark Zuckerberg. Back to this. It's good to know about multiple things. Some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields. Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Do not let work means something that other people tell you to do. And that is such an important sentence. Don't let work means something other people tell you to do. That is the lived experience of most people alive and dead. In fact, Paul has another essay called How to Do What You Love, where he says only a few hundred thousand and his guests, a few hundred thousand people ever actually figure this out. Let me read. I'm going to just read an excerpt from that other essay real quick. He says with such powerful forces leading us astray, it's not surprising that we find it so hard to discover what we like to work on. Most people are doomed in childhood by accepting the axiom that work equals pain. Those who escape this are nearly all lured onto the rocks by prestige or money. How many even discover something they love to work on? A few hundred thousand perhaps out of billions. And so I think that sentence hits even harder after you read the excerpt from his past essay. Don't let work means something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it'll probably be on a project of your own. What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious as you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge.

> The Importance of Curiosity and Luck in Finding the Right Work

Summary:
Being curious and lucky plays a significant role in finding the right work.

Mark Twain's journey exemplifies this, starting with a fortunate break that led to a successful book and changed his life. Paul Graham emphasizes the importance of taking action and being open to chance encounters or unexpected sources that guide one to the right path.

Curious individuals cast a wide net, increasing the likelihood of discovering the ideal endeavor.

Optimizing for interestingness helps in navigating career choices, as fields should become more fascinating with learning.

Having unique and diverse interests can be advantageous, leading to strong and productive work outcomes while exploring uncharted territories.

That scoop leads him to his lecture career, which further enhances his public profile, which then leads him to this 23-week trip in Europe, which in turn is going to lead to the source Material for his first great book, the first publishing success that he ever has, which then in turn changes his life forever. That example from Mark Twain is a microcosm of exactly what Paul Graham is talking about here. What she should do if you're young and ambitious, but don't know what to work on. Mark Twain was young and ambitious. He had no idea what to work on. He put pen to paper. He took action as another way to think about that, right? When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting or by reading a book that they happen to pick up. At the end of that paragraph, Paul has a fantastic footnote. There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the most subtle is that by casting a wide net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in The first place. Okay, so back up top, when in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. A field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you. Do not worry if you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes are, in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes often are strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive, and you'll be more likely to find new things if you're looking where few others have looked Before.

Paul writes a lot about the advantages that small teams and small companies have over larger ones, but there's also disadvantages. And one thing that startups cannot or small companies cannot afford to do is not focus. And so he has this idea that you should ignore what other people are doing and consider only what will work best. In a big company, you can do what all the other big companies are doing, but a startup can't do what all other startups do. I don't think a lot of people realize this even in startups. Then he goes into the fact that a small company can actually succeed by only me. They actually only need to be good at one thing. When we started VioWeb, we had no experience in business. We didn't know anything about marketing or hiring people or raising money or getting customers. Neither of us even had what you call real job. The only thing we were good at was writing software and we hoped that would save us. And then he talked about some other good ideas they did when he was building a startup. One, they focused on speed. Our development cycle was so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release. And he said a key to that was they had a technical advantage. He talks a lot about this book, in this book about programming languages. I've admitted this. He felt that the fact that they used this unknown but really advanced programming language called LISP was a massive advantage to VioWeb. He says, in business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand. You read that again, in business, there's nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don't understand. He thought LISP was that for them. And we see an idea that you and I have talked about over and over again bad boys move in silence for hundreds of years of the history of entrepreneurship. We see people they have an edge and they shut up about it. I never said anything publicly about LISP while we work on VioWeb. This was no accident. A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible. Okay, so now I want to jump to Paul's essay called Taste for Makers. He says, I was talking recently to a friend who teaches at MIT. His field is hot now. He's writing this back in 2002. His field is hot now and every year he is inundated by applications from would-be graduate students. A lot of them seem smart, he said. What I can't tell is whether they have any kind of taste. Taste. You don't hear that word much now. And yet we still need the underlying concept, whatever we call it. Well, my friend meant was that he wanted students who were not just good technicians but who could also use their technical knowledge to design beautiful things. For those of us who design things, these are not just theoretical questions. We need good taste to make good things. Let's try considering it as a practical question. How do you make good stuff? So again, I think all this ties together, right? He says, how do you know what to work on? Once you know what to work on, how do you make something great? Why is that important? Because if when you make great things or good things that other people find valuable, that is how you build wealth. All of these ideas connect across multiple decades and I don't know, 100 different essays. It's really remarkable and I don't know if I that would have clicked if I haven't spent, you know, last few weeks not only reading through his entire website but also picking up this book and reading this as well. So back to this idea of taste. Remember, this is taste for makers. If you mention taste nowadays, a lot of people will tell you that quote, taste is subjective. They believe this because it really feels that way to them. Saying that taste is just personal preference is a good way to prevent disputes. The trouble is, it's not true. You feel this when you start to design things. Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do it better. Football players like to win games, CEOs like to increase earnings.

> Values Evolve Through Power and Cooperation

Summary:
Differentiating between development processes that preserve core values versus those that do not requires clarity on what is valued and endorsed.

The effectiveness of ethical norms, such as liberalism and cooperation, stems from their capacity to reduce conflict and enhance productivity in society. These norms arise not only from philosophical considerations but also from evolutionary dynamics and moral cognition, suggesting they may evolve into intrinsic values due to their instrumental benefits.

Understanding the relationship between these evolved values and natural forces can help frame the integration of powerful entities, such as AI, into society, emphasizing that our values, shaped through a combination of natural and social power, can coexist with the challenges posed by technological advancements.

Yeah, so the context on that post, as I'm talking about this hazy cluster, which I call in the essay, niceness slash liberalism slash boundaries, which is this sort of like somewhat More minimal set of like cooperative norms involved in like respecting the boundaries of others and kind of cooperation and peace amongst differences and like tolerance stuff like That, as opposed to your favored structure of matter, which is sometimes the paradigm of values that people use in the context of AI risk. And I talk for a while about the ethical virtues of these norms. But it's pretty clear that also, why do we have these norms? Well one important feature of these norms is that they're kind of effective and powerful. Liberal societies are, secure boundaries, save resources wasted on conflict, right? And liberal societies are often more like, if they're better to live in, they're better to immigrate to, they're more productive, like all sorts of things. Nice people, they're better to interact with, they're better to like trade with, all sorts of things, right? And I think it's pretty clear if you look at the, both like why at a political level, do we have like various political institutions? And if you look kind of more deeply into our evolutionary past and like how our moral cognition is structured, it seems like pretty clear that various like kind of forms of cooperation And like kind of game theoretic dynamics and other things went into kind of shaping what we now, at least in certain contexts also treat as a kind of intrinsic or terminal value. So like some of these values that have kind of instrumental functions in our society are also kind of reified in our cognition as kind of intrinsic values in themselves. And I think that's OK. I don't think that's a debunking. Like all of your values are kind of like something that kind of stuck and got kind of treated as a terminally important. But I think that means that sometimes the way, in the context of the series where I'm talking about deep atheism and our sort of relationship, the relationship between what we're pushing For and what nature is pushing for or what sort of pure power will push for. And it's easy to say, well, there's like paper clips, which is just just one place you can steer. And Pleasure is just another place you can steer or something. And these are just arbitrary directions. Whereas I think some of our other values are much more structured around cooperation and things that also are effective and functional and powerful. And so that's what I mean there. I think there's a way in which nature is a little bit more on our side than you might think because part of who we are has been made by nature's way. And so that is in us. Now, I don't think that's enough necessarily for us to beat the gray goo. Like we have some amount of power built into our values, but that doesn't mean it's going to be such that it's kind of arbitrarily competitive. But I think it's still important to keep in mind that this is, and I think it's important to keep in mind in the context of integrating AIs into our society that I think we've been talking A lot about the ethics of this.

But really, like the tipping point for me was, you know, realizing how it fit with one of my core principles. And this actually comes from Yuval Noah Harari from his book, Sapiens, where he mentions that the evolutionary advantage of humans is that we cooperate flexibly in large numbers, right? Like it's not that we're intelligent, it's not that we're anything else. It's the fact that we cooperate flexibly in large numbers. So if this is the evolutionary advantage of humans, anything that boosts this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers is a kind of like a civilizational upgrade.

> Distinguishing Games by Information, Luck, and Skill

Summary:
Games can be differentiated by three key dimensions: information availability, luck, and skill.

Some games involve uncertainty where crucial information is concealed, leading players to infer or guess. This hidden information impacts decision-making.

Games like poker have undisclosed information while chess reveals all details openly.

This diversity in information transparency is a significant factor in distinguishing games, alongside luck and skill.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
People who aren't very familiar with games or who don't dwell on them probably think they're all variations on the same theme. But actually, there are big differences. I want to touch on them so I can go on to create an effective analogy between gaming, gambling, and investing. Importantly, games vary in three primary dimensions, information availability, luck, and skill. Some games, but not all, require players to deal with uncertainty. Whether you or your opponent will win or what action you should take might hinge on information that's not available to you, and about which you can make inferences or guesses at best. Thus, in some games, there's important hidden information, and in others, there isn't. In poker, blackjack, and gin, you don't know what courage your opponent is holding. But in chess and backgammon, everything's plain to see. The position of the playing piece is on the board. Nothing is hidden. Obviously, this is a big difference.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
I have in my head a number of different frameworks for how a company can make money over time in a competitive world. And a simple example from microeconomics would be that of a Corneau oligopoly. And just for those who maybe forgot their game theory from college, there are two broad types of oligopoly in the economics literature. One is Cor the other is Bertrand. The key difference between them is that in a Cournot oligopoly, the competitors choose the quantity of things they're going to sell first. And the price falls out. It's the thing that moves. In a Bertrand oligopoly, the competitors choose the price that they're going to sell at. And then the quantity falls out. And it's the thing that moves. And this seems like a subtle change. But it results in a pretty big difference in the competitive equilibrium. So in a Bertrand oligopoly, that's non-cooperative. That is to say that people aren't figuring out a way to signal and to sort of cooperate. Then what happens typically if you imagine, like let's say I'm selling cookies at the state fair. And there's me and there's another competitor and there's two spots to sell cookies. And we both can manufacture all the cookies we want in a truck next to the fair. And let's say people only buy cookies based on price. And they're right next to each other in perfect competition, all the rest. So what happens is, you know, let's say each cookie costs a dollar to make. Well, I start out, maybe I started selling them for ---. I want to make a dollar a cookie. But my competitor realizes that if they charge **Readwise ID:** 883601460

**Note:** Real-world application of Cournot vs Bertrand oligopoly models showing how strategic interactions create different equilibria

.98. And before we know it, we're both down to a dollar and we're making no money per cookie. And that's the equilibrium. That's the non-cooperative equilibrium. We make no money. But now let's imagine instead that I had to bring a tray with a fixed number of cookies and I can't make more. Well, what happens is that morning I'm trying to figure out how many cookies I'm going to make. And I ask myself the question, should I make one more cookie? And if I make one more cookie, it'll have two effects. One is I'll get to sell an extra cookie and I'll make whatever the profit on the cookies are times that cookie. But the other is it will increase the number of cookies in the market, which will drive down the price of cookies. And this will cause me to sell all of my cookies at a slightly lower price. And so as I'm making this decision, you can see how there would be a natural maximization point where I maximize profits. Now, in this case, there's two competitors. So when I add an extra cookie to the market, I lower the price for me. I also lower the price for my competitor. I don't internalize the effect on my competitor. So I end up behaving like a monopolist, but a monopolist who only absorbs half of their price impact in the marketplace. In other words, one who faces more elastic demand. But I still behave like a monopolist, just with one facing more elastic demand. So there's still monopoly profits to be had. So the equilibrium gets worked. We both solve our differential questions at the same time. We get to an equilibrium and lo and behold, we, we, we end up, um, we both end up making profits. Okay. This is all very theoretical. So you start studying the cruise line industry. Okay. Just to pick an example of an industry. I'm not that I'm not, I've never owned a cruise line business, but it's been, you know, I've been around it. It turns out that if they want more cruise ships, they can't just snap their fingers and have more cruise ships. The number of cruise ships for a good long while is essentially fixed. And so what they do is – this is a perfect example of a corno-oligopoly. The number of cruise ships is fixed in the short to medium term. So they maximize yield, which basically means they're adjusting price. That leads you down a path of, okay, this is a business where just from that perspective, there's lots of other things to think about. There's brand, there's distribution, there's a lot of things. But from that perspective, now you have a sense as to how this is a business where there should be some monopoly profits. But what will mediate how much economic profits there are is how many competitors there are, right? And also how much elasticity of demand there is. And then, of course, other factors. And then, of course, there's also the question of, are you in equilibrium? Or did people accidentally bring too few? Let's say, let's say you show up at the fair, and you brought a tray of cookies, and it rains. Well, now cookies, price of cookies plunges, and you lose money, right? Or let's say you show up, and for whatever reason, a famous singer shows up, and there's a gazillion people, and now you sell the cookies at premium. So, you know, are you at equilibrium is another, you know, good question. But it turns out that a lot of travel businesses are corno-eligopolies, rental cars, air travel, cruises. So this is an example of using a mental model that allows you to understand certain types of businesses in a somewhat systematic way. One of the investments I sort of cut my teeth the most on where I sort of first had a lot of success was in the construction equipment rental business. And that is also, it is a Cornell oligopoly. You know, in any market, there's a sort of fixed number of rental companies and they own a certain amount of equipment and their ability to change that in the short term is constrained. And therefore, you know, it's a corner of oligopoly. And it's also a good one because elasticity of demand is very inelastic. Turns out nobody said like, you know, I see the price of manlifts is down a hundred bucks this week. I'm going to rent one. And at the same time, nobody ever said like, I'm not going to build my building because the price of manlifts is up a hundred bucks this month. I hope that got to your question. But basically, you can think about there being many of these things, like these concepts that you can then kind of follow to their conclusions. And, of course, life is complicated, and every company has, like, often a whole confluence of these things. And what you're really looking for is a business where you have sort of a bunch of these things that are working together. With the cruise ship industry, like, the idea that it takes a long time to build a cruise ship and you can't just snap your fingers and have another cruise ship is fairly invariant to technological Change in society. Like, I guess maybe there's some future state where we can like, you know, print them out, print them out. But like for now and for the foreseeable future, this is going to be fixed. And so you're looking for, you know, relatively sort of technological change invariant advantages and layered and interwoven that kind of give you the business. And then from there, you know, I have a friend who jokes that a good value investor's, you know, memo is like 20 pages about the business and one page on the valuation. So like from then from there, it's like, I don't know, like, is it cheap? Does it make a lot of money relative to the price? Is it going to grow a lot relative to the price? You know, these are pretty trivial calculations.

Speaker 2
If I was thinking about how you would spend your time, it would seem to be incredibly valuable to collect models like this

**Type:** real_world_impact  

**Note:** Multi-agent systems excel when agents can coordinate and specialize - parallels human cooperative intelligence

> The essence of search is compression: distilling insights from a vast corpus. Subagents facilitate compression by operating in parallel with their own context windows, exploring different aspects of the question simultaneously before condensing the most important tokens for the lead research agent. Each subagent also provides separation of concerns—distinct tools, prompts, and exploration trajectories—which reduces path dependency and enables thorough, independent investigations.

Once intelligence reaches a threshold, multi-agent systems become a vital way to scale performance. For instance, although individual humans have become more intelligent in the last 100,000 years, human societies have become *exponentially* more capable in the information age because of our *collective* intelligence and ability to coordinate. Even generally-intelligent agents face limits when operating as individuals; groups of agents can accomplish far more.

Our internal evaluations show that multi-agent research systems excel especially for breadth-first queries that involve pursuing multiple independent directions simultaneously. We found that a multi-agent system with Claude Opus 4 as the lead agent and Claude Sonnet 4 subagents outperformed single-agent Claude Opus 4 by 90.2% on our internal research eval. For example, when asked to identify all the board members of the companies in the Information Technology S&P 500, the multi-agent system found the correct answers by decomposing this into tasks for subagents, while the single agent system failed to find the answer with slow, sequential searches.

Multi-agent systems work mainly because they help spend enough tokens to solve the problem. In our analysis, three factors explained 95% of the performance variance in the [BrowseComp](https://openai.com/index/browsecomp/) evaluation (which tests the ability of browsing agents to locate hard-to-find information). We found that token usage by itself explains 80% of the variance, with the number of tool calls and the model choice as the two other explanatory factors. This finding validates our architecture that distributes work across agents with separate context windows to add more capacity for parallel reasoning. The latest Claude models act as large efficiency multipliers on token use, as upgrading to Claude Sonnet 4 is a larger performance gain than doubling the token budget on Claude Sonnet 3.7. Multi-agent architectures effectively scale token usage for tasks that exceed the limits of single agents.

> the wisest investors have earned extraordinary returns by investing in the unknown and the unknow- able (UU). But they have done so on a reasoned, sensible basis. This essay explains some of the central principles that such investors employ. It starts by discussing “ignorance,” a widespread situation in the real world of investing, where even the possible states of the world are not known. Traditional finance theory does not apply in UU situations.

  

Strategic thinking, deducing what other investors might know or not, and assessing whether they might be deterred from investing, for example due to fiduciary requirements, frequently point the way to profitability. Most big investment payouts come when money is combined with comple- mentary skills, such as knowing how to develop real estate or new technologies. Those who lack these skills can look for ”sidecar” investments that allow them to put their money alongside that of people they know to be both capable and honest. The reader is asked to consider a number of such investments.

  

Central concepts in decision analysis, game theory, and behavioral decision are deployed along- side real investment decisions to unearth successful investment strategies. These strategies are distilled into eight investment maxims. Learning to invest more wisely in a UU world may be the most promising way to significantly bolster your prosperity

1. The importance of being entrepreneurial and seizing opportunities even when they are not readily presented, emphasizing the value of taking initiative, being proactive, and showing persistence in pursuing one's dreams.

2. People who undergo significant change often experience a shift in their internal identity, leading them to question who they can become in new circumstances. Cognitive psychology introduces the concept of identity foreclosure, where individuals prematurely settle on an identity without exploring all possibilities.

3. Identity can be shaped by experiences that limit opportunities, anchoring identity to 'why' rather than 'what' fosters resilience and adaptability, allowing for continuous self-exploration and adaptation in the face of life's changes.

4. Embracing multifaceted identities can help adapt to various challenges and changes in life without feeling a loss of self-worth, having identity layers that serve as a safe landing in difficult times.

5. In challenging conversations, approaching with genuine curiosity, increasing the question to statement ratio, and validating perspectives through questioning can lead to mindset change and evolving opinions.

6. Setting goals in proactive behaviors rather than abstinence, building in flexibility with 'emergency reserves,' bridging the empathy gap between present and future selves, and designing environments to make desirable options more accessible can help in achieving goals effectively.

> Intentional Rituals and Habitual Change

Summary:
Rituals, defined as intentionally acquired habits, serve a mission or goal, like enhancing performance or managing health.

Humans are creatures of habit, wired to follow routines automatically, but possess the unique ability to pause between stimulus and response to create novel responses. By developing tiny intentional habits, individuals can rewire circuitry, introducing new behaviors that align with their desired missions and goals.

Redirecting habits requires a significant investment of time and energy, driven by a powerful purpose, to break free from destructive routines and take control of personal outcomes.

Speaker 1
A ritual, as we define it, is an intentionally acquired habit that serves the mission, whatever the mission is. So to become a better tennis player between points, to become destabilized blood glucose during a match, what should you be eating? Maybe a banana drinking lots of water and some specific hydration elements between games on changeovers. You can have a ritual for getting up in the morning that you intentionally develop. It's kind of a tiny habit that you decide is going to help you navigate in life more successfully and the things that matter to you. We need rituals. I will tell you, it's called the unbearable automaticity of being. We are creatures of habit. And some of those habits just destroy us. I mean, they don't help us at all. We don't even know how we got them. We just some one day we won't woke up and this is how it is. We love to sleep late. We don't like to get up in the morning and on and on and on. And a lot of things just, you know, they just happen. But our days pretty much unfold automatically. You're going to do tomorrow pretty much what you are wired up habitually to do. Now, the beauty of being human is that we have the ability to pause between the stimulus and response and create a novel response. And that takes a certain amount of time and a lot of energy infusion until we rewire the circuitry. And it is a, it's basically it's a neurological loop that enables you to continue doing certain things. And in the animal kingdom, they're completely wired up with instincts and routines that enhance survival. But human beings actually can stop and reflect. I don't want to be 40 pounds overweight. I don't and then you have to link this mission, which is maybe very difficult to get off of drugs or whatever. You have to get a purpose that is so powerful that it just it just grabs you and ushers you into the storm and you will not surrender. And most of the time, it's these little tiny habits getting up at a certain time, setting the alarm and having breakfast always at a certain, even if it's a small amount, you get yourself Started rather than having a big lunch and then a huge dinner and going to bed. You start understanding, you know, you don't have to be a victim of your environment. You actually can intervene, but it takes a lot of heavy duty lifting. And it's all made possible by your energy investment intentional.

This reasoning is relational in adolescents and adult. 3. Post conventional reasoning how did the cookie get there? Should I take it? What’s the deeper story here. Is my moral stance greater than some law that says I can’t do this. Inner rules show rules and law abiding aren’t always just willing to deal with consequences even death for sticking to your guns. This is also egoistic. Being good and law abiding are different. You need to live with yourself after the decision. This can be inspiring, but also insufferable behavior. Arguments against viewing the world, post conventionally, and valuing stage two and the importance of interpersonal relationships. Often it’s very tough to do the morally right thing unless it’s easy. Strong will power is more about distraction and reappraisal than stoicism. It’s hard to avoid something in front of you and easier to change your environment to make easier decision. In a study where animals were hit by their mother they didn’t shy away but held on harder.

A craving is not what you want but the underlying desired state. You don’t want a cigarette you want the relief it provides. Craving a change which is your reason to act. Cues are meaningless unless it’s linked to a desire that produces a craving and the response is the actual act. The response can only be acted upon if you want to and are able to. The response is about obtaining the reward. The reward is the end state. Cue is noticing craving is wanting response is about obtaining the reward. Rewards satisfy us and teach us.

**Note:** Temptation bundling and environmental design - pairing desirable with undesirable tasks for sustainable motivation

> Designing Environments for Success and Motivation Techniques

Summary:
Designing our environments can help us avoid relying on willpower by making desirable options more accessible.

Motivation tends to peak at the beginning and end of goal pursuit but dip in the middle, so setting shorter goals helps navigate through this low motivation phase. Temptation bundling involves pairing an undesirable task with a desirable one, allowing the rewarding activity only during the undesired task to create a motivating association.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
I know Angela Duckworth focuses a lot on this. So that we don't have to employ willpower, we should really focus on the way that we design our lives and the choice architecture of our lives. What this means in practice is to the extent that you can control your environment, you just make things unavailable to you. And you make other things really readily accessible and available to you. So the canonical example of this is cafes where they try to encourage healthy eating. They put all the junk food at the bottom and they're in opaque containers and then they put the healthy food like the fruits and vegetables and healthy snacks on full display at eye level. So it's the things you're more likely to grab. And those little are actually quite effective and they don't require as much willpower because you've just architected your environment accordingly. And so that's what I would recommend in situations like that. And then the other thing we know, Shane, about motivation is that we don't have stable amounts of motivation over the course of goal pursuit. This is some research by my friend, Ayelet Fishbach. She it the middle problem. So basically what happens is we have a huge burst of motivation at the outside of a goal. We all can resonate with this, right? January 1st, the lines to the gym are long. And then like January 20th, all of a sudden they start to wane, right? So we all enter goal pursuit with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement. And then we also find actually that towards the end of goal pursuit, as we're reaching the end, we experience monotonic increases in motivation. It was called the goal gradient effect, where as we get closer to the goal, we get even more motivated and excited about it. But there's a lull in the middle. So that's the problem, right? It's like you see, ooh, there's like a dip in the motivation. And I think we all have the lived experience of this, right? It's like, oh, my gosh, I was so excited in the first three weeks of this thing. And now I'm kind of losing steam. So what Ielle recommends is to actually just make the middle periods of time as short as physically possible. So rather than setting a year long goal, which we might feel an instinct to do, because we want to set a really ambitious goal. And so we're like, let's make it a year -long goal because then I can really achieve the best version of this thing that I have my site set on. Instead, you set week -long goals. So that way, the middle period is not a multi -month period. It's actually just a few days in the middle of the week, right? And you can get away with a day or two of not working very hard, right? And then climbing your way back out on say that final day of low motivation. And so I really like this idea of trying to, from a temporal perspective, kind of like bound your motivational cycles so that you can experience this dip in a more constrained space.

Speaker 2
It's almost like you're a marathoner and you hit a wall and you're sort of at like mile 10. And instead of focusing on the finish line, you focus on how do I get around the next corner. And then you accomplish that goal and then you focus on the next corner. So you shorten the distance between where you are and what you want to accomplish.

Speaker 1
Exactly. I want to share the one motivational technique that I use like every single day of my life. Please do. Most transformative for me. So this is from my friend Katie Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania. She calls it temptation bundling. The idea is very simple actually, but what you do is you pair a desirable task with an undesirable task. So something that you have to do, right? So let's say have to unload the dishwasher. You have to fold laundry. You have to get some sort of work assignment done. You have to work out. Whatever the thing is that you have a little bit of dread towards is the undesirable task. That's the thing that needs to actually happen. And then you pair it with a desirable activity that offers you more of an immediate reward. Okay, so this might be, okay, while I'm folding laundry, I listen to my favorite pop album that just came out, or while I'm on the treadmill, I'm watching Netflix, or while I am doing this Really tough work assignment, I'm treating myself to my favorite candy. And the key part, the only way in which this temptation bundling works is if you actively deny yourself that rewarding activity in all other domains of life so that it really feels special And it feels coupled with the undesirable activity. So I can't be watching Netflix all the time and then feel motivated to go on the treadmill to just watch more Netflix, right? I have to choose, say, a show where it's like you can only watch the show you're on the treadmill. You can only listen to this pop album when you're folding laundry. You can only eat this candy when you're working on writing your book, whatever the thing is, right? And I have found this to be such a game changer because you get really swept up in what happens with, for me, shitty reality TV shows. And I really want to know what happens. And so I do feel a pull to go back to doing the undesirable thing just because I'm so eager to see what happens in the plot line. And so that one has been really effective for me. But again, you have to, you do have to be very rule -based here, which is that you can't indulge in that thing in other spaces.

> When you see people ensconced in their craft, you’ll notice that they are often living what I’ve come to think of as a Zone 2 life, after the exercise trend. They are not manic; they are persistent. They’re not burning out with frantic energy, but they are just plowing their furrow, a little bit farther, day after day.

They live with an offensive spirit. They are drawn by some positive attraction, not driven by a fear of failure. They perceive obstacles as challenges, not threats. On their good days, they’ve assigned themselves the right level of difficulty. Happiness is usually not getting what you want or living with ease; it is living, from one hour to the next, at a level of just manageable difficulty.

**Note:** Morning workout and spiritual practice optimize both body and soul - discipline of will creates centered foundation for day

> Transcendence Through Discipline and Commitment

Summary:
Transcendence is not an inherent feeling experienced daily; it requires deliberate choices and the establishment of disciplined routines that prioritize creativity and spiritual well-being.

Morning rituals, such as exercise and spiritual practices, set a tone for the day, facilitating focus and productivity despite feelings of reluctance. The act of love, whether in marriage or friendships, is similarly rooted in commitment rather than sentimentality; it involves a conscious decision to prioritize another's well-being over one's own immediate desires.

This commitment transcends emotional fluctuations, embodying Thomas Aquinas's notion of willing the good of others.

Happiness emerges not from fleeting feelings but from deliberate actions and choices that reflect one's values and responsibilities.

Viewing life as a personal enterprise, akin to a startup, highlights the importance of leadership in one's health and happiness. True fulfillment and joy stem from applying discipline and commitment, enabling ongoing growth and transformation along a purposeful journey, rather than relying on momentary gratifications.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
This is an important thing to understand about transcendence. You don't feel transcendence all the time. You decide to experience transcendence and put yourself in the circumstances to experience awe. I'm sure you go outside and there's a lot on your mind. You've got a very busy and hectic and stressful life. And you don't feel it. You don't feel it every single day. Like I got a mask every day. I don't feel it every day.

Speaker 2
I wake up in atheists alive. And why do you do that?

Speaker 1
I do that because it was part of the protocol for living the life that I want to live. I mean, I get up at 445 like you. I work out for an hour, body. I go to mass, soul, then I work. That's when my creativity is highest. Now, of course, I'm also, you notice, I'm optimizing my dopamine. I'm sucking as much dopamine into my prefrontal cortex, which gives me creativity and focus for the three hours that I need to write. And that's a good motivation to do so. But I also want to optimize both body and soul at the very beginning of the day. So I'm centered on the things that really matter to me, notwithstanding how I feel. I wake up at 445 in the morning. I'm like, back day, I don't want to do back day. I don't want to leg day. I don't want to do that, but I do it. I do it. It's the discipline of the will that in and of itself is so important. And then I go to mass. I don't want to do it a lot of days. I don't want to do it, but that's not the point.

Speaker 2
Do you think that there is a deficit of that as well of that idea? So for example, you alluded to marriage earlier and anybody who's listening to this, who's married, especially who's been married for many, many years, they'll acknowledge that So much of the almost perverse joy of marriage is that you make a lot of sacrifices for another person and you find yourself putting someone else ahead of yourself. For me, that's a very hard thing to do. I'm just so hardwired to be such a selfish guy that it's really a wonderful practice to do something where I know, like, I'm going to make my wife's coffee today because she would do the Same for me.

Speaker 1
Well, part of that is that you have discovered and not enough people have that love is not a feeling either. Happy is not a feeling, but love isn't either. Love is a commitment. Martin Luther King, one time he gave this very beautiful sermon on the most transgressive passage in the Christian Bible, which is Matthew 544, love your enemies. And he says, Jesus says, today I give you a new teaching. You have heard that you should hate your enemies and love your friends. I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you. He says, Jesus doesn't say to like your enemies because that's a sentimental thing. The like is to feel. To love is to decide. This is what's going on between you and your wife. The satisfaction, the disciplining of your own will comes from the decision to love her. That's the magic. That's the magic in marriage. That's the magic in friendship. That's the magic that you can have in a relationship with your kids. Like if they were all about your feelings, hell, I'd be divorced. God knows my wife would bail on me. I'm just a pain being around me. She decides every day to love me. Thomas Aquinas, based on Aristotle, Aristotle talked really compellingly about love and friendship. Aquinas in 1265 raised the Sumithiologica, his magisterial contribution to philosophy. He introduced Aristotle to the West. Everybody was a Platonist, Till Aquinas. He defined love as to will the good of the other as other. When you're making your wife that cup of coffee notwithstanding your feelings, you're willing her good for her not you. That discipline of the will to love another person like that, that decision to do so, is completely transformative. That's transcendent to the day to day experience. The animal path is, I don't like to make coffee. I don't feel like it. The divine path is to love her, is to will her good as her. That's the human distinction. That's organized life.

Speaker 2
It really seems that that's almost a theme here of happiness. That happiness is much more about deliberate decision making, deliberate choices as opposed to reactive feelings, which that's obviously the extent to which we've discussed it. I think I like this thing that Oprah said, not happiness, but happiness. Happiness.

Speaker 1
The thing I like the most is she said it was, let's write a book, but totally. She said, let's spread this idea to a bunch of other people. I've been listening to your show for a long time. This is the salient theme. Take charge, man. Take charge. Don't leave your health up to what feels good right now. Take charge of it. I mean, you're the boss. The startup is you. You're the entrepreneur. The guy in charge of the enterprise. You're the CEO. Treat it as such. The CEO doesn't do what feels good all the time. The CEO does what's right, notwithstanding her, his feelings. That's the secret to happiness. It's treating your life like a startup. It's your philosophy of health and longevity is my philosophy of happiness because it's all one thing. When you talk about better, happier years or health span, I'm talking about happy span. That's what it comes down to. You're just not going to do it by doing what feels good in the moment. You're not going to discipline the will sufficiently to be able to make the decisions that lead you on this divine path that can give you this thing that you actually see. Is it perfect?

> Kleiber's law, named after Max Kleiber for his biology work in the early 1930s, is the observation that, for the vast majority of animals, an animal's metabolic rate scales to the ¾ power of the animal's mass. Symbolically: if q0 is the animal's metabolic rate, and M the animal's mass, then Kleiber's law states that q0 ~ M¾. Thus, over the same timespan, a cat having a mass 100 times that of a mouse will consume only about 32 times the energy the mouse uses.

**Note:** Explains how emotions are produced by limbic system - fear/anger involve amygdala, 74-millisecond response time affecting decision-making

> Feelings Are Not Happiness

Summary:
Happiness is a distinct concept separate from feelings, often misconceived as being one and the same.

While feelings serve as evidence of happiness, they do not encapsulate its essence. Many individuals chase fleeting happy feelings, mistakenly believing these sensations represent true happiness.

This pursuit can lead to dependency on external factors like sleep quality or relational dynamics, rather than fostering a genuine sense of happiness.

Furthermore, happiness and unhappiness can coexist, with individuals experiencing both simultaneously, a notion supported by advancements in neuroscience.

The brain processes emotions through the limbic system, highlighting four primary negative emotions—sadness, anger, fear, and disgust—that evolved to protect and inform us about our environment. For instance, fear and anger trigger immediate survival responses, while sadness signals social disconnection. Interestingly, humans uniquely engage with aversive emotions through controlled exposure, allowing them to find value in uncomfortable experiences, such as extreme sports or cold plunges. This ability to engage in metacognition enables better emotional regulation and a deeper understanding of one's mental states. Positive emotions include joy, stemming from achievement after effort, and interest, driven by the innate pleasure derived from learning and exploration.

These emotional responses have evolutionary roots, emphasizing the importance of both understanding and navigating the complexity of emotions to achieve true happiness.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
There's a lot of stuff I want to talk about with you on this topic, but let's begin with a question, which is what's the difference between happiness, which is what you write about and Happy feelings. Are they the same thing?

Speaker 1
They're not. And this is a really important misconception. All of my students and most of us actually have, we live in the era of feelings. If you'd talked to my parents or God does my grandparents about feelings, they would scratch their head. What are you talking about? I mean, talking about your emotions all the time, ephemera, feelings seem so counterproductive. And in point of fact, our grandparents were right. Feelings are not happiness anymore than the smell of the turkey is your Thanksgiving dinner. Feelings are evidence of happiness. And that's incredibly good news. I mean, a lot of people think that happiness is a feeling. It's quite incorrect. There are many better technical definitions of happiness, but they produce a lot of feelings. They're associated with a lot of emotions, which is limbic system activity, a part of the brain, a 40 million year evolutionary process that developed the limbic system to create emotions. That signals information is what it comes from. If you mistake these feelings for the underlying phenomenon of happiness, you're going to be chasing it all over the place. You'll be chasing ghosts. How I slept last night, what I ate for breakfast, if my spouse yelled at me this morning, that's what's going to determine my happiness. You wind up being managed as opposed to having any prayer of managing your own happiness. So that's the first thing to keep in mind. It's not feelings.

Speaker 2
It's hard to differentiate, though. Having read this stuff several times, you have to remind yourself when you're in the throes of what I just refer to as negatively valenced feelings that this is not a statement of my overall State of happiness. Yeah, for sure. And then what's the relationship between unhappiness and happiness? Are they polar images?

Speaker 1
How do they coexist? Well, for the longest time, if you even go back to the ancient philosophers, there was the idea that happiness and unhappiness exist on the spectrum. So unhappiness would be the lack of happiness. We know a lot better now, given the explosion of neuroscience and the way that emotions are produced, that in fact, you can be happy and unhappy or have happy and unhappy feelings in parallel. So for example, the average person spends about 40% of their time with predominantly positive feelings. It sits in a neutral idol of positivity. Most people do not everybody. About 16 or 17% of the time the average person has predominantly negative feelings. Something is going on. That's more intense. Part of the reason is because negative emotions get your attention and they're supposed to. Evolution favors negative emotions. Positive emotions, nice to have. Negative emotions, pay attention because that could cost you your life.

Speaker 2
What are some of those, if you think about this evolutionarily and not even going back to millions of years ago, but just going back hundreds of thousands of years ago to the origin of Our species as homo sapiens, what do we think are some of the most powerful negative emotions that would drive action?

Speaker 1
There's basically six fundamental emotions or basic emotions. These are the building blocks of all emotional life that are produced by the limbic system of the brain, four negative and two positive. The four negative emotions are sadness, anger, fear and disgust. All four of those have a very strong evolutionary basis. Fear and anger of course have to do with threat. They involve the amygdala of the brain. You know, when a car is about to run you over in your pedestrian and a crosswalk, that crosses your visual cortex and is recorded in the occipital lobe of your brain as an enormous predator. That signals to your amygdala to send the signal through the hypothalamus of your brain to your pituitary glands, which signals your adrenal glands above your kidneys to spit out stress Hormones. That happens in 74 milliseconds. By that time you're sweating, your heart is pumping, you've jumped out of the way and you flipped off the driver, a combination of fear and anger in response to the enormous predator. Three seconds later, your prefrontal cortex catches up and you say, I shouldn't have flipped him off. That's not my values or whatever it happens to be. So that's your limbic system keeping you alive. That's fear and anger. Then of course there's disgust, which involves the insular cortex of the brain, also part of the limbic system. That's when you pull something out of the back of your fridge you forgot about a few weeks ago and you hold it and you're like, that signals don't eat it. And so anything that might carry a pathogen signals that basic negative emotion of disgust to you. Now it can be misattributed to people. That's what demagogic politicians always do. That's what the media does to us. It tries to reprogram the insular cortex, the insula of the limbic system of the brain so that when somebody disagrees with you politically, you look at them like a cockroach. That's what demagogic leaders and dictators have done for time immemorial so that people will undertake barbaric acts against people in their own countries, lisas of war, et cetera. And then last but not least is sadness. Sadness is also evolved. Sadness is what you feel largely in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex of the brain and another part of the limbic system. That's mental pain. Usually when you're either socially excluded or you're separated from a loved one. Now that's something that's evolved because you don't want to be separated from your tribe. You don't want to walk the frozen tundra and die alone. But what happens, for example, in grief, grief is un-remediated sadness. And the reason is because your brain is saying, make this separation go away and you can't just because of other person is permanently gone, aka dead or divorced or whatever it happens To be. And so the grief is just this pulsating activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex of the brain saying, I must be reunited with that person, but I can't be. And it takes a lot of time in many cases for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex to stop registering that sadness that pain.

Speaker 2
The sadness we feel when a person dies, which would be the ultimate form of separation, is a more extreme version of say a social isolation that you might feel like what...

**Note:** Fear neutralizes love and can turn off other feelings like a switch - physiological basis of emotional decision-making

> Embrace Mortality to Conquer Fear

Summary:
Confronting mortality serves as a powerful method to mitigate fear, particularly the fear that inhibits love and happiness.

Love and fear are opposites; while love fosters happiness, fear can extinguish it. Rooted in both philosophical principles and neuroscience, this connection implies that embracing love can neutralize fears, and addressing the fear of mortality can unlock deeper emotional connections.

Most people harbor unacknowledged fears surrounding death, often linked to concerns about being forgotten or feeling irrelevant.

This existential dread can manifest in varied ways, such as fear of failure, particularly among high achievers who associate their worth with success.

To tackle these fears, a reflective exercise akin to a therapeutic meditation based in Theravada Buddhism encourages individuals to consciously familiarize themselves with their mortality, gradually dampening fear’s hold. By repeatedly exposing oneself to thoughts of personal failure or decay, one can alleviate the terror associated with these fears, leading to greater freedom and enhanced relationships. Engaging in structured reflection about these fears is essential; individuals may find that their relationship with death and failure evolves over time, requiring continuous introspection and meditation to maintain emotional clarity and resilience.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
But the result is that of all of this is that this is a lot of what leads to people's fears. People talk to me a lot about what they're most afraid of. I ask people about that a lot. And part of the reason is because my main focus of my happiness work is love and love and fear are opposites. Love and hatred are not opposites. Hatred is downstream from fear. And this is a philosophical principle from Lao Tzu in St. John the Apostle, but it's also a neurocognitive regularity where you find that how the brain works, you tend to find that love neutralizes fear and fear can turn off love in every other Feeling like a switch because of the way that brain is designed. The main focus of my work in happiness is the subject of love. And part of the reason is because love is the nuclear fuel runs of happiness. If you want to know one thing about how to be happy, happiness is love full stop. And there's a ton of longitudinal data that shows this. There's a ton of data that shows people who are in their 80s and 90s who are really happy. If you look back in their 20s and 30s and 40s and 50s, what they all have in common is drawing relationships that they were cultivating and working on, real love relationships in terms

Speaker 2
Of romance and family and real friends, not just the old friends.

Speaker 1
Now the interesting thing is when you're studying love is you also have to study its opposite. And the opposite of love is fear. That's a philosophical truism. You know, Lao Tzu talked about the fact that fear and love are opposites. And we teach on the apostle, but also we find this in modern neuroscience in the way that emotions are processed in the human brain. Psychology shows this abundantly that love and hatred in opposites, hatred is downstream from fear. So if you want to understand what turns off love in your life, when people come to me and say, I don't have enough love, I'll say, well, tell me about what you're afraid of. And when people come to me and they say they have too much fear in their life, we'll say, well, I need more relationships. We need more love to neutralize the fear. So the big fears that I ask people about, one of the things that I find is that everybody has a deaf fear. This is an interesting thing. You know, most people say, I'm not afraid of dying. And I'm not afraid of dying. I mean, like Peter, you and I are like, the reaper comes tomorrow. I was like, okay, I live right. I'm actually not afraid of that. But I do have a deaf fear. Everybody does. And it has to do with the extinction of how you understand yourself. And that gets back to the mortality paradox. The idea of not existing has some manifestation almost everybody's life, whether it's, I'm really afraid of becoming irrelevant. I'm really afraid of being forgotten. That's your mortality problem. That's your death fear. You know, for me, it's like, I think about it. The one thing about my health I'm most worried about is dementia. My mother was demented. I was in early stage dementia, when she was my age. She was mid 50s. She was in early stage dementia. She lived for another 15 years. But it was really, really bad. It was really a bad ending. And for me, I mean, my whole living is inside my head. I work on my biceps, but it doesn't matter how strong they are for me to be able to make a living and support my family and support my employees, etc. So that really freaks me out. Well, guess what? That's my death fear. It's the functioning of my brain is my death fear. Everybody has something like this, whether it's really ego related or has to do with skill related, everybody's got their mortality terror. This is one of the things that we need to dominate if we want to be happy. And I have an exercise, believe it or not, Peter, that I give my students on how to do that. Number one is you have to figure out what it is. You have to do some serious reflection on what your death fear is. And for most of my students at Harvard is fear of failure. These are super high performing. I mean, this was you. I mean, you went to Stanford and then you did all this fancy college stuff. And so my guess is that you never had any academic failure and you were perhaps pretty afraid of academic failure because you'd never experienced it. And because it would have been problematic in your family. If you had started to fail some classes in college, I was going to guess, right?

Speaker 2
I'm a bit confused because what you spoke about earlier makes a lot of sense as a death failure because I see a cognitive decline being tied to physical death because it's an end of life Thing. I'm a bit confused about what the students, these 29 year olds are equating failure in life, for example, starting a business and having it fail with actual death.

Speaker 1
So it's basically I am a success machine. Most of my students start off as very objectified by their parents where their parents say, you're the special one, you're successful, you always get age, you're a hard worker, you Know, get it done. And they start to see themselves as kind of homo economicus. They see themselves as high performers and they're very bright and they're very hard working in the results. They don't experience any failure in school. I mean, for me, these are absurd things. You got to be on an exam who cares. You know, I've flunked out of college. Man, I know failure, but for them, they've never experienced these things. So it feels like a mortal threat because it's a threat to who they think they are, which is a successful person, somebody who never fails and is very foreign territory to them. So whether they're deaf fears, failure or cognitive decline or being forgotten or being irrelevant or actually dying, the technique for getting beyond this is really all the same. And it comes from that I found very successful is to do what is called a Theravada Buddhism, the Maranasati meditation. This is the nine part death meditation that Theravada Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka and Thailand and Vietnam. They will undertake in which often they'll contemplate corpses, photos of corpses in various states of decay. And they'll say, that is me and that is me. And they have a nine for this Maranasati is a meditation in which they imagine themselves decaying, dying and then a rotting bloated corpse. And then it's so graphic is super graphic. It's a boy.

Speaker 2
And that's the point and super accurate. Like it really is how a human corpse decays.

Speaker 1
It's just unbelievable. And what you're trying to do is what psychologists would call exposure therapy. You're exposing yourself to the inevitable truth. Like I heard you say, Peter, I'm going to die. Okay, fine, fine, fine. I'm going to think, no, think about it. Think about it. Why? Beca...

How you choose to interpret them is up to you - its your choice.

Happiness is when nothing is missing.

It's when you remove the sense that something is missing from your life.

We constantly walk around thinking:

"I need this, I need that"

Which keeps us trapped in unhappiness.

Happiness is the absence of desire.

"Desire is a contract you make with yourself until you get what you want."

We go about our lives desiring things all day long and wonder why we're unhappy.

One overwhelming desire, let go of everything else.

Happiness is presence.

A very small percentage of our brain is focused on the present.

Most of the time, its worry about the future or regretting the past.

This is what makes being grateful so hard.

Happiness is separate from your external situation.

Happiness is destroyed by envy.

Envy is poison that can eat you alive if you let it follow you around.

"If you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous."

Happiness is acceptance

We don’t always get what we want, but sometimes what is happening is for the best.

The sooner you can accept it as reality:

The sooner you can adapt to it, and find peace.

Happiness is embracing death.

You’re going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter.

"Enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment."

* * *

Happiness is all there is.
There is no legacy.
There’s nothing to leave.
We’re all going to be gone.
Our children will be gone.
"In the grand scheme of things, the Universe has been around for ten billion years. It’ll be around for another ten billion years."

Happiness is a responsibility.

Our lives are a blink of an eye firefly in the night.

We need to take advantage of the time we have here.

We have the responsibility to be happy for the small amount of time we have.

**Note:** Most decisions are type 2 (reversible) not type 1 - iterative mindset allows early course correction

> Embrace Freedom in Decision Making

Summary:
People often hesitate to make decisions due to an over-reliance on organizational structures, fearing that they lack the freedom to act.

It is essential to recognize that individuals have the agency to make choices and must be willing to face the consequences. Furthermore, there is often confusion between type one (irreversible) and type two (reversible) decisions, leading to unnecessary anxiety about the permanence of their choices.

Adopting an iterative mindset is crucial, as most decisions are not final and can be adjusted.

Lastly, there is a lack of understanding in decision science, where many miss the opportunity to analyze and build a well-structured proposal for decision-making, which should include context, risks, assumptions, and alternatives.

Practicing this structured approach can significantly enhance decision quality and accountability.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
So if we get out of the org structure or the operating system and go down to the individual level, where is it that you see people make mistakes in decision making at that sort of micro level That are correctable or predictable?

Speaker 1
Well, I think the first place that we make mistakes is perhaps not understanding our own freedom. So in systems like that, what tends to happen is people are hesitant to make a decision because it doesn't feel like I should be able to. So there's a lot of blaming the system and a lot of looking for guidance and permission and all that kind of stuff that still exists. When it's like, you can just go do what you need to do. You can go, you can go play and you can deal with the consequences. So that's one piece of the puzzle. The other piece is that we're not great at telling the difference between type one and type two decisions, the kind of one way door, two way door metaphor that people use, just on balance. Folks struggle a little bit with like, how would I roll this back versus how is that something I can't roll back? We'd like to believe that every decision we make is like the end of the world. And it just really is not. You know, even things that feel really final are just not final. And so I think getting into that iterative mindset around decision making is important. And then the last thing is we just don't have a lot of practice or experience with decision science. And so we haven't spent a lot of time learning what makes a good decision or a bad decision, how to think about building context, how to think about risks and assumptions and alternatives. And so really building the proposal for a decision in the right anatomy, like we have the context or the tension that's driving this, the recommendation, the risks, the assumptions, The alternatives, the ways to know if this worked. That structure is not intuitive for most folks. And so when they make a decision, they just make it, they're just like, mmm, blue. And then, and then we make the decision and then we never go back. And in fact, when I was studying some of the biggest decisions we make in companies, I did a big analysis on M&A for the book. We don't even look back on that stuff very often.

In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of contracting wealth and compulsive recirculation”
“Perhaps it is one secret of their power that, having studied the fluctuation of prices, they know that history is inflationary, and that money is the last thing a wise man will hoard. The experience of the past leaves little doubt that every economic system must sooner or later rely on some form of the profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity. Substitutes like slavery, police supervision or ideological enthusiasm prove too unproductive too expensive or too transient. Normally and generally men are judge by their ability to produce- except in war where they are judged by their ability to destroy.”

> The Four Turnings of a Long Human Lifetime

Summary:
The four turnings in a long human lifetime are the high, representing a time of strong institutions and modest individualism; the awakening, characterized by a shift to individualism and a rejection of obligations; the fall, marked by weak institutions and strong individualism; and the winter, where institutions are reconstructed and institutional power is strengthened.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
So the way you see this whole thing is a long cycle of about a long human lifetime divided up into 20 to 25 year segments, right? Each one a generation long, each one corresponding to a new generation coming of age, a new generation coming into childhood. And the way you look at it as the first turning is what we call the high. This is a period like the late 40s, 1950s, early 60s, presidencies of Truman and Eisenhower and John Kennedy, a period when institutions are strong individualism is weak. The country feels like it's more than the sum of its parts. We're personally modest about ourselves as individuals, but we feel we're part of a great organization that can really function well and actually change the world. That's followed by that's the spring season. The summer season would be the second turning. That's the awakening where we throw off all these obligations. We transform ourselves into much more individualistic society, spearheaded as usual by the rising generation. That would be Boomers in this case. We call that the profit archetype, by the way. And then the third turning is the fall season. And this would be most recently the late 1980s, 1990s, early OOs, right? And that's when Xers are coming of age. Boomers are moving into midlife. Institutions are weak. Individualism is strong. And I think we all have that experience of going into bookstores and every upbeat book you see is about me, myself, and I. And I can do anything. I can conquer the world. And every downbeat book is about what we collectively share. It's like the end of family, the end of politics, the end of community. You ever notice that? That really is the period we've been living through. I always think the 1990s, the light motif was really Francis Fukuyama, the end of history, right? Markets and individualism around the world would triumph. The governments would fade away. And we would just contract with each other. And then finally, the fourth turning, which is the winter season, where we reconstruct institutions and institutional power in a very different sort of the opposite of the awakening, Right? So the awakening, we think institutions are too powerful, particularly the rising generation in a fourth turning, we think institutions are too weak, particularly the rising generation. I think absolutely true today with millennials. They think institutions are too weak. They need to be strengthened.

**Author:** The Memo by Howard Marks  
**Relevance:** 9/10  
**Quality:** 8.8/10  
**Type:** empirical_evidence  

**Note:** Financial cycles driven by psychology - demonstrates how boom-bust cycles are inevitable manifestation of historical pendulum swings

> Cycles Are Inevitable: The Fragility of Optimism

Summary:
Company profits experience significant volatility driven by operating and financial leverage, creating a cycle where rising confidence leads to increased risk-taking and subsequent downturns.

This boom-bust cycle is not merely a result of irrational behavior but an inherent characteristic of the financial system, as posited by Hyman Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis. As optimism grows, debt levels rise, making the economy more fragile and inevitably paving the way for recession.

The relationship between asset valuations and volatility highlights how a lack of fluctuations can lead to future instability.

Understanding this cyclical nature, marked by cause and effect, is crucial for navigating market dynamics.

Past experiences, such as the surge in subprime mortgages leading to the financial crisis, exemplify how history can be misleading without recognizing the cyclical framework in which these events unfold.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Company profits rise and fall more because companies have leverage. They have operating leverage and financial leverage. And so company profits are much more volatile than the economy. But stock prices, for example, vary like crazy. They fluctuate up and down. If you see a chart of stock prices relative to company earnings, what you're seeing is the radical volatility of psychology relative reality. When things go well, as Morgan and I have been describing, and people feel strong and they feel encouraged and they feel that they'll prudently take advantage of the potential of the Future by amping up their portfolio, they take a very positive attitude toward the future, toward the use of leverage, toward the purchase of risky assets. At the same time, the financial institutions are feeling equally good about it. So they become willing to lend more to a given investor for a given purpose. So the leverage in portfolios goes up. As the good times roll on, the leverage is rewarded through magnified profits, and that causes the investor to do even more of it. And as stock prices rise, the investor buys more and with more and more borrowed money increasing the riskiness of the portfolio as the times become riskier. Then eventually something turns down, the companies don't do as well, the market sags, stock prices decline, the investor now starts to take magnified losses. He might get a margin call, or he might just liquidate and get out on his own and uses less and less leverage and sells stocks at lower and lower prices because they can't stand the pressure. They had overestimated their ability to live with risk, and their attitude towards leverage becomes more harsh at the same time that the banks become unwilling to provide leverage And in fact try to recall some of the leverage they put out in the past. So everything goes swimmingly on the way up and people take on more and more risk and people get depressed and things go terribly when things swing down until at the bottom, portfolios Tend to be less levered and to hold fewer assets even though they have become much cheaper. So it's a highly cyclical process, but it follows the pattern of most other things, especially in the financial world and especially when human nature is involved.

Speaker 2
Just said, it's so important to realize how inevitable these cycles are, that whenever you have a boom-bust cycle, it doesn't mean that people have lost their minds. It doesn't mean that we've all gone crazy. It doesn't even necessarily mean that regulators and politicians have made mistakes. They're completely inevitable. There was a great economist named Hyman Minsky, and he came up with this idea called the financial instability hypothesis. And to grossly simplify it, basically what he said to us, when there are no recessions, people get optimistic. When they get optimistic, they go into debt. When they go into debt, the economy is fragile. And when the economy is fragile, you have a recession. And inherent in that was a lack of recessions plants the seeds for the next recession. And that's why you're always going to have recessions. The same thing applies to the stock market, any asset class, that a lack of volatility is what plants the seeds for future volatility. In the stock market, if there was no volatility, people would very rationally bid valuations up. When valuations go up, they become fragile. When you become fragile, you get volatility. It's completely inevitable. I think that's important because this is what causes people to underestimate volatility, at least intuitively. They think, well, there will be a recession when people go crazy or when politicians screw up, whatever it might be. It's like, no, you don't need any of that. You don't need people to screw up. You can just have natural volatility in all asset classes based off of what Hyman Miski figured out 50 years ago. So that's why these things are completely inevitable. They don't require a car crash, so to speak, in the economy. It's just the natural tendency of what markets do.

Speaker 1
What Morgan just illustrated so eloquently is the cause and effect nature of cyclical events. I wrote a book a few years ago called Mastering the Market Cycle, and I said in there that people might think that a cycle consists of a series of events which typically follow in a given Progression. So you have A and then B happens, and then after a while C happens and sometimes D happens and then it goes on to E and that's followed by F. No. A happens. It causes B. B causes C. C causes D. And if you replay Morgan's description of the process through which the occurrence of a recession is ensured, you see this causality. And you make a big mistake if you think about cycles without thinking about causality. I think the great example is the boom in mortgages and especially subprime mortgages that led to the global financial crisis. Basically, to put it short, people looked at history. They said there's never been a nationwide wave of mortgage defaults. And so they engaged in practices that guaranteed there would be a nationwide wave of mortgage defaults. It's that simple. I think it's important too. There's an interesting thing here that's a great thing for the overall world.

> Previously rates were determined by gold flows but now when they made gold exchangeable rates could be set and monetary policy became a thing it wasn’t just a simple output. Countries could finally conduct an active monetary policy to change rates to achieve a certain end but this became politicized quickly. The fed thought their goal was now to balance inflation and unemployment to stabilize prices. People wanted to reduce discount rates. But monetary policy was so loose that it led to a market boom but created fragility in the system. Don’t have loose policy in good times because when the bad times inevitably come it’s a disaster. The fed believed they had tamed interest and speculation was natural. Believes they shouldn’t regulate that they fueled a 37% s&p return in one year. Andrew Mellon declared the end of cycles. Everything was under control except it wasn’t. This low interest rates created a bubble because the future was discounted too much. Money that flowed abroad was being spent on us exports and the money people were spending was from investment income not their job so economy was proped up on investment success which was on lower rates then the bubble popped it all collapsed. Federal bankers met in Long Island us bankers wanted to keep rates low while France wanted a true rate. These low rates spured a ww1 recovery. Fed then cut rates again which basically set the us for failure. Hayek said the inflation of credit won’t solve europes problems. Then the fed lowered rates and bought more. Hoover wanted the free money. Strong who was the head of the fed got sick and died fed started to restrict policy created a vacuum with all capital going to the us. Stock market first half of year was up 30% but eventually everyone raised rates and it all collapsed. All the bankers were thrown into depressions or mental panics. Banks collapsed and this slowly made its way through the financial system popping every bubble everywhere starting the depression. Shows how the economy is a complex system. Keynes didn’t believe the crash would ever come and was buying more during the depression. Economists all failed to understand economy and lost so much money.

Before going he wrote as we think which described a memex this was an automatic personal filing system that set the stage for both hyperlinks www and personal computing from a values perspective. This was too late for it’s time but too early for the computers it influences as it was 1945. Weiner proposed a computer to bush to help the ww2 effort but he didn’t allocate funding viewing the ideas of radar and the bomb as more practical but he could’ve sped up computing decades. Bush developed a differential analyzer which was a preview to a computer for the Rockefeller institute and he hired a university graduate named Claude Shannon to work on it and he did his phd on this noting the use of binary calculations to do math for these machines. This also allowed computers to work its way through many different conditional steps allowing for it to think more human. Shannon’s masters thesis on switching remains one of the most important papers of the 20th century it set the table for how computers worked. There was a teletype computer device developed at bell labs which set the stage for Norbert wieners idea on computation not a few months after the display. Adinasov a professor at Iowa decided he wanted to make a computer and predicated it around base 2 numbers and vacuum tubes along with Berry a grad student it became know as the adinasov berry computer or abc. Much of the desire for a computer was to save time doing math. Howard Aiken developed the Mark 1 at Harvard modeled after the ideas of charges babbage this with ibm engineers became the first computer to enter the public consciousness but the base 10 system among other features made it impractical. The 1930s was about setting the conceptual framework for what would eventually be the computer. Another program was ENEAC which was thought to be too far in the future to be practical but was what von noumann needed as part of the Manhattan project given the high number of calculations

**Note:** Ancient revolutions happened gradually then suddenly - demonstrates how institutional changes follow path-dependent patterns over time

> Kings previously had political and military power but slowly in these ancient cities political and military power started to fade but the ones taking it left the kings in as spiritual and religious leaders. The Patricians took charge and while there was the idea of rights it was just an aristocraticy instead of a king the function of government was the same it was just an oligarc. People had votes but only the ones patricians nominated and this was replacing one ruler for another. There were kings of city states with the power and the king in the big city was just a figurehead. This first revolution was one that changed rules but only more deeply ingrained the current ways of society. The kings were cowtowing towards the poor and the aristocrats took over to maintain their power and status. Slowly the idea of primogeniture the oldest inheriting things went away and then the poor started being given more rights as the aristocrats started fighting for supreme control. This was the catalyst to the tearing down of the old institutions while the past incident had been a revolution to propagate and more deeply ingrain old institutions but the lust for power and individual desire for freedom combined to create this storm. Revolution changed exterior but not the constitution of society. It was the aristocrats seeking to cement their power. Political revolution to prevent a social revolution. Revolutions in history have no real account but happen gradually and slowly suddenly you find the customs in different centuries are different but you can’t point where the trail went awry there’s no clear moment. Slowly here the younger children got citizenship rights then the clients got those rights and the institutions were destroyed gradually. The clients were at the mercy of masters and slowly the masters had to ceed rights like land to tend and freedoms or these clients would leave because they saw there was life away from the masters so the masters had to give them concessions or lose free labor and warriors. The more freedom they got the more they wanted the beginning of the end. Slowly through being exposed to the understanding of their status did they grow to demand more and more which lead to their freedom. The idea of the gens got more and more diluted until there was nothing left.

Graham Weaver
I haven't, at every step of the way, I'm running a business that's bigger than I've ever run before. She's run, she's been the chief people officer at really large companies. So she can help guide me through like, hey, this org chart makes no sense. And here's some ways you could be thinking about it.

Patrick O'Shaughnessy
I want to come back to the definition question again. Personal growth. What does that mean? Let's see, it's get better. What does better mean? I'll go like a little bit deep here, but I think that ultimately each of us has most of the answers inside of us in our intuition.

Graham Weaver
Like I think we have this compass and you could call it your intuition, your soul, whatever that is. That's incredibly powerful. It's like our own LLM. It's taken every experience and every input we've ever had, and it's storing all this, and it has all the answers. And so I think a lot of personal growth is understanding what that intuition is telling you and spending the space and time to really understand what it's saying and getting out of your Head, which is a lot of times confusing things. And then having the courage to go do what it says. That's probably my highest level of personal growth. Because I think if you can do that over and over, you'll self-actualize and become the best version of yourself, for lack of a better word. And then there's a whole bunch of things underneath that to try to make that happen.

Patrick O'Shaughnessy
What are some of those things?

Graham Weaver
Some of those things are designing, being really intentional about your life, figuring out what does a successful life look like for you in all your different areas and really spending Time on that and designing it. And then having a practice where you're working toward that almost on a daily basis.

Patrick O'Shaughnessy
Is there an episode of the second part of the description of courage? It's a key word, it seems like, that stands out in your memory. Like, what does that mean in practice for you? What's a time that you felt like a thing you, your intuition told you and then required courage, which is a big, a big word.

Graham Weaver
I mean, I'll tell you like a really early one. This is the first one that came to mind when you just asked the question, but as an early one. So I'm in Toledo, Ohio, and to be the popular and be the cool kids, they didn't care at all about school. A lot of them were drinking, doing drugs.

Good questions in here to refer to. Also valuable to keep people who tried to quit. Money can valuable task relevant feedback. The Peter principle people always get over promoted to their level of incompetence because people should continue to get challenged. This eventually leads to them failing which is ok but you need to demote them which is hard if not impossible. Having a better organization is worth mild discomfort. Create internal train course and iterate that over time. Training is your duty and try to improve your course. Teaching is hard and iterative. It’s not about learning but implementation. Measure present and future value and how much you are hurting the present in intensity or trade offs vs the future.

Need to build on different eventualities jumping to conclusions on limited information is a huge source of bias and error. People who heard one sided evidence were more confident than those who heard both sides because they didn’t even conceptualists thru could be wrong.

We don’t think probabilistically we crave certainty and with a large enough sample crazy things happen pretty often think birthday paradox but scaled to 100mm people.

Pessimism is seductive and spreads faster than optimism. We’re seeing more negative stuff because that sells. We hate and actively avoid uncertainty we crave certainty.

Predictive processing says that we don’t experience the world as it *is*, but as we *predict* it to be. Our conscious experience [is a construction](http://slehar.com/wwwRel//cartoonepist/cartoonepist.html) of layered mental habits acquired through past experiences. We don’t see the world through our eye sockets; we don’t hear the world through our ear canals. These all feed information into our brains, which conjure our experience of the world from scratch — like when we dream — only that in waking consciousness, they’re at least trying to match what they whip up in our experience to what might actually be going on in the world outside our skulls.

**Note:** Detailed explanation of how meditation affects predictive hierarchies and precision weighting

> For example, during FA meditation, one engages attention (increases precision) of a *specific* prediction at earlier levels of the predictive hierarchy (e.g., the breath). With practice, one can sustain attention on the same prediction for a longer period of time while decreasing the frequency and relative precision of predictions higher in the hierarchy. When one practices OM, different predictions will still arise in experience but are assigned lower precision, as illustrated by smaller and lighter ovals. With ongoing practice of OM, predictions arise less frequently and become less ‘sticky’, thus also disappearing faster. Increasingly experiencing without appraisal (an earlier level of the predictive hierarchy) dominates as predictions, or contents of experience, become less relevant and capture attention less. Finally, during ND meditation, the awareness inherent in experience becomes the foreground. In FA and OM, predictions within experience are still the prominent event in experience. However, in the ND state, all contents of experience, as well as the subject of experience, fall away, and only awareness (without background or foreground) remains.

Integrated information theory starts with consciousness itself then inverts. Consciousness is described as axioms that its real structured specific integrated and definite as the essential nature of consciousness. Consciousness is the integration of information through different neural circuits interconnecting that can be seen. We see when we’re asleep or in an unconscious state the entire neural circuit doesn’t light up just that one brain region but to be conscious our entire brain lights up. Our brains are probabilistic machines taking input from the outside world making predictions then adjusting to the outside world. Goedl no set a proofs of logic in a formal system can be sufficient to prove the entire system as consistent. No sets of rules can ever prove a system.

**Note:** Connectionist knowledge and belief web - how our predictive models are built from connections

> How do we construct our beliefs
	We would all like to think we can change our mind when the facts change, but we would also love to win the lottery, so the world isn’t perfect.  Before we can endeavor to change our minds, we must first seek to understand how it works.  We could discuss neuroscience until our heads turn blue, but I do not know too much about neuroscience, so instead we will abstract knowledge and beliefs to a meta level of connectionist knowledge and the belief web/stack.  Looking at it this way everything we know is connected in some way to something else we know and moreover some things are built on top other things.  For example, the knowledge of almost anything rests on the foundation of the language in which it is being communicated.  Language is a core foundational until of knowledge in one way, but in another it’s useless.  There is a big difference between the word chair and a physical chair; they in many ways are the same thing, but in a very real way could not be more different.  The combination of lived experience and language forms a deep foundation of beliefs, experiences, and knowledge that leads to a reaction to “I sat down on a comfortable chair and panicked” that is very different to “I sat down on a comfortable chair and relaxed.”  We construct our world as layers and levels.  Our relaxation in a comfortable chair is different than it would be in a rigid one, but moreover relaxation to one person might be reading a book and to another playing a violent video game.  Here we are jumping up and down the stack in one way while traversing the web in another sense.  What is key here is that our knowledge is a very interdependent construction.  All of our knowledge lies in some relational connection to our model of the world.  Moreover, some of these connections are deeper in the stack and thus harder to change.  This hints at why it can be really easy to change our mind on some things, but on others its deeply painful to even think about doing so.  This is different for different people.  If you love milk chocolate and detest dark chocolate, but one day have the best piece of chocolate ever your opinion of dark chocolate may totally change.  If you are just an average joe, this is easy, but if you are the president of the milk chocolate association, even considering trying dark chocolate may be sacrosanct.  

Knowledge is connectionist  manifests as a web but also a stack but all of our models have bias and assumptions deeply engrained in them  we can advance knowledge in a local optimum way within the current models  but to make big changes we need to transcend paradigms and be willing to see anomalies as not a one off thing but as structural change needed to be made to our core assumptions and biases this is how knowledge grows  and we change our minds we make a really painful ripping up of the connections in our heads leaving space for the formulation of new ideas and growth  the highest level of knowledge is when we can exist outside the paradigms when were not in fields studying problems but when were studying great problems and using different models from different fields  instead of constructing beliefs in this field specific way we should use the connectionist knowledge we have and synthesize it on a whatever problem may be interesting to us  feynman hold 6 problems in your head  munger hold these high leverage models in your head  meadows transcend paradigms  problem focused field popper 
Knowledge lies in the connections all of our knowledge is predicated on other knowledge
 Belief web – this forms a web of beliefs that we have where because our knowledge is connectionist our beliefs are connectionist
 believe stack – not only are our beliefs woven together in a web but there also stacked on top of each other with some more foundational than others.  The ones at the bottom are almost impossible to move because you have to take down everything they are built on and start from scratch and so we are more hesitant to examine and change these deeper beliefs in the stack because it’s a lot of mental work to do so and requires swallowing a lot of pride
 bias inherent in models – because all knowledge lies in its connection to other things all paradigms fields and ideas make assumptions.  Economics assumes rational actors while evolution assumes variation and natural selection.  These things are unseen but drive the outcomes of what’s going on because their the deeper in the stack fundamental assumptions we are making about the world.  
	Paradigm shifts are when we uproot the bias inherent in models because we no longer believe they are valid

> We were able to measure a kind of "distance" between features based on which neurons appeared in their activation patterns. This allowed us to look for features that are "close" to each other. Looking near a "Golden Gate Bridge" feature, we found features for Alcatraz Island, Ghirardelli Square, the Golden State Warriors, California Governor Gavin Newsom, the 1906 earthquake, and the San Francisco-set Alfred Hitchcock film *Vertigo*.

This holds at a higher level of conceptual abstraction: looking near a feature related to the concept of "inner conflict", we find features related to relationship breakups, conflicting allegiances, logical inconsistencies, as well as the phrase "catch-22". This shows that the internal organization of concepts in the AI model corresponds, at least somewhat, to our human notions of similarity. This might be the origin of Claude's excellent ability to make analogies and metaphors.

**Note:** Different belief templates create different meanings from same experience - classic predictive processing example

> There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other is an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says: “Look, it’s not like I don’t have actual reasons for not believing in God. It’s not like I haven’t ever experimented with the whole God and prayer thing. Just last month I got caught away from the camp in that terrible blizzard, and I was totally lost and I couldn’t see a thing, and it was 50 below, and so I tried it: I fell to my knees in the snow and cried out ‘Oh, God, if there is a God, I’m lost in this blizzard, and I’m gonna die if you don’t help me.’” And now, in the bar, the religious guy looks at the atheist all puzzled. “Well then you must believe now,” he says, “After all, here you are, alive.” The atheist just rolls his eyes. “No, man, all that was was a couple Eskimos happened to come wandering by and showed me the way back to camp.”
It’s easy to run this story through kind of a standard liberal arts analysis: the exact same experience can mean two totally different things to two different people, given those people’s two different belief templates and two different ways of constructing meaning from experience. Because we prize tolerance and diversity of belief, nowhere in our liberal arts analysis do we want to claim that one guy’s interpretation is true and the other guy’s is false or bad.
Which is fine, except we also never end up talking about just where these individual templates and beliefs come from. Meaning, where they come from INSIDE the two guys. As if a person’s most basic orientation toward the world, and the meaning of his experience were somehow just hard-wired, like height or shoe-size; or automatically absorbed from the culture, like language. As if how we construct meaning were not actually a matter of personal, intentional choice.
Plus, there’s the whole matter of arrogance. The nonreligious guy is so totally certain in his dismissal of the possibility that the passing Eskimos had anything to do with his prayer for help. True, there are plenty of religious people who seem arrogant and certain of their own interpretations, too. They’re probably even more repulsive than atheists, at least to most of us.
But religious dogmatists’ problem is exactly the same as the story’s unbeliever: blind certainty, a close-mindedness that amounts to an imprisonment so total that the prisoner doesn’t even know he’s locked up.
The point here is that I think this is one part of what teaching me how to think is really supposed to mean. To be just a little less arrogant. To have just a little critical awareness about myself and my certainties. Because a huge percentage of the stuff that I tend to be automatically certain of is, it turns out, totally wrong and deluded. I have learned this the hard way, as I predict you graduates will, too.

**Note:** Superposition hypothesis shows how neural networks compress and predict - mirrors predictive processing

> Harnessing the Power of Superposition in Neural Networks

Summary:
Recognizing the interplay between confidence and assumption is crucial in problem solving, where pushing boundaries within certain assumptions can lead to valuable insights.

The superposition hypothesis suggests that neural networks can represent more concepts than the number of dimensions available in their architecture through a phenomenon called compressed sensing, where high-dimensional, sparse vectors can be projected into lower-dimensional spaces without losing essential information. This can allow for distinct concepts to coexist within fewer dimensions, helping justify the existence of polysemantic neuronal representations that respond to multiple, often unrelated stimuli.

As such, these neurons do not simply adhere to one clean feature but can represent complex relationships that challenge traditional interpretations.

Gradient descent, in this context, aids in optimizing this search for efficient representations amidst the sparse model landscapes.

While the number of distinct concepts is likely bounded by the number of parameters, existing theorems indicate that the potential for coexistent, nearly orthogonal vectors exists, suggesting exponential growth in capability relative to neuron count. Addressing polysemanticity within neural networks becomes crucial for understanding specific functionalities of neurons and their interconnections. The extraction of monosemantic features from polysemantic networks through techniques such as dictionary learning, particularly via sparse autoencoders, offers a pathway for uncovering these structured meanings that naturally emerge, thus validating the efficacy of both linear representations and the superposition hypothesis in neural networks.

Transcript:
Speaker 4
I think one wants to be able to pop up and sort of recognize the appropriate level of confidence. But I think there's also a lot of value in just being like, you know, I'm going to essentially assume, I'm going to condition on this problem being possible or this being broadly the right Approach. And I'm just going to go and assume that for a while and go and work within that and push really hard on it. And, you know, if society has lots of people doing that for different things, that's actually really useful in terms of going and getting to, getting, you know, either really ruling Things out, right? We can be like, well, you know, that didn't work. And we know that somebody tried hard, or going and getting to something that does teach us something about the world. So another interesting hypothesis is the superposition hypothesis. Can you describe what superposition is? Yeah. So earlier we were talking about word to back, right? And we were talking about how, you know, maybe you have one direction that corresponds to gender and maybe another that corresponds to royalty and another one that corresponds to Italy And another one that corresponds to, you know, food and all of these things. Well, you know, oftentimes maybe these word embeddings, they might be 500 dimensions, a thousand dimensions. And so if you believe that all of those directions were orthogonal, then you could only have, you know, 500 concepts. And, you know, I love pizza. But like, if I was going to go and like give the like 500 most important concepts in, you know, the English language, probably Italy wouldn't be, it's not obvious at least that Italy would Be one of them, right? Because you have to have things like plural and singular and verb and noun and adjective. And, you know, there's a lot of things we have to get to before we get to Italy and Japan. And, you know, there's a lot of countries in the world. And so how might it be that models could, you know, simultaneously have the linear representation hypothesis be true and also represent more things than they have directions. So what does that mean? Well, okay, so if linear representation hypothesis is true, something interesting has to be going on. Now, I'll tell you one more interesting thing before we go and we do that, which is, you know, earlier we were talking about all these polysomatic neurons, right? These neurons that, you know, when we're looking at Inception V1, there's these nice neurons that like the car detector and the curve detector and so on that respond to lots of, you know, To to very coherent things. But it's lots of neurons that respond to a bunch of unrelated things. And that's also an interesting phenomenon. And it turns out as well that even these neurons that are really, really clean, if you look at the weak activations, right? So if you look at like, you know, the activations where it's like activating 5% of the, you know, of the maximum activation, it's really not the core thing that it's expecting, right? So if you look at a curve detector, for instance, and you look at the places where it's 5% active, you know, you could interpret it just as noise, or it could be that it's doing something Else there. Okay, so how could that be? Well, there's this amazing thing in mathematics compressed sensing. And it's actually this very surprising fact where if you have a high dimensional space and you project it into a low dimensional space, ordinarily you can't go and sort of unproject It and get back your high dimensional vector, right? You threw information away. This is like, you know, you can't invert a rectangular matrix. You can only invert square matrices. But it turns out that that's actually not quite true. If I tell you that the high dimensional vector was sparse, so it's mostly zeros, then it turns out that you can often go and find back the high dimensional vector with very high probability. So that's a surprising fact, right? It says that, you know, you can have this high-dimensional vector space, and as long as things are sparse, you can project it down, you can have a lower-dimensional projection of it, And that works. So the Suitsich hypothesis is saying that that's what's going on in neural networks. For instance, that's what's going on in word embeddings. The word embeddings are able to simultaneously have directions be the meaningful thing. And by exploiting the fact that they're operating on a fairly high dimensional space, they're actually, and the fact that these concepts are sparse, right? Like, you know, you usually aren't talking about Japan and Italy at the same time. You know, most of those concepts, you know, in most sentences, Japan and Italy are both zero. They're not present at all. And if that's true, then you can go and have it be the case that you can have many more of these sort of directions that are meaningful, these features, than you have dimensions. And similarly, when we're talking about neurons, you can have many more concepts than you have neurons.. So that's the, at a high level of superstition hypothesis. Now it has this even wilder implication, which is to go and say that neural networks are, it may not just be the case that the representations are like this, but the computation may also Be like this, you know, the connections between all of them. And so in some sense, neural networks may be shadows of much larger, sparser neural networks. And what we see are these projections. And the strongest version of the superstition hypothesis would be to take that really seriously and sort of say, you know, there actually is in some sense this upstairs model, this, You know, where the neurons are really sparse and all-interpol, and there's, you know, the weights between them are these really sparse circuits. And that's what we're studying. And the thing that we're observing is the shadow of it, and so we need to find the original object.

Speaker 3
And the process of learning is trying to construct a compression of the upstairs that doesn't lose too much information in the projection.

Speaker 4
Yeah, it's finding how to fit it efficiently or something like this. The gradient descent is doing this. And in fact, so this sort of says that gradient descent, you know, it could just represent a dense neural network, but it sort of says that gradient descent is implicitly searching over ...

> the whole show of consciousness can be extinguished — temporarily, that is — altogether.

Nirodha-samāpatti, or “cessation of thought and feeling,” is a summit of [meditative attainment](https://academic.oup.com/jaar/article-abstract/XLV/2/226/832348) in Theravada Buddhism, the oldest surviving form of Buddhism most commonly practiced in Southeast Asia. Cessation is like going under general anesthesia, but without any drugs. Consciousness can be [switched off](https://psyche.co/ideas/what-happens-to-the-brain-during-consciousness-ending-meditation) from the inside, for — according to the scriptures — up to seven days at a time (though the first [lab data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612322001984?via%3Dihub) on cessation looked at a more modest 90-minute stretch).

Cessation is a bonafide advanced meditation thing — I’ll make zero effort to convince you it’s accessible to us non-monastic folks. But [according](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/advanced-meditation-alters-consciousness-and-our-basic-sense-of-self/) to neuroscientist Matthew Sacchet, who leads the Meditation Research Program at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, the early data collected from studying cessations with neuroscience gizmos supports the idea that meditation deconstructs the predictive mind.

“Cessation could thus reflect a final release of the expectation to be aware or alert,” Luakkonen and Slagter [write](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612322001984?via%3Dihub). It’s like a bottoming-out of the predictive mind.

Coming out of cessation, meditators can observe the reconstruction of the predictive mind, prior by prior. “That puts us in a special state,” Chandaria said. “You can call it reprogramming mode. And in reprogramming mode, we can start to reprogram ourselves in ways that could be more conducive to human flourishing.”

> Information Theory description

Shannon was more interested in the nature of problems not necessarily implementation. Always looking for root or first principles. Treated information as a quantity not a thing. Was focused on how well you can send messages. There’s always noise in messages and you want to limit the noise and maximize the signal. Information is the ability to resolve uncertainty. Information provided the recipient the ability to get something not previously known not redundant. The essence of information is the core uncertainty that is resolved by its receipt. Signal through the noise. The less the recipient knows about what comes next the more information is being revealed. There are often common language patterns the reveal less information or nuanced complicated ones that reveal a lot of information. For example a u following a Q gives little information because U often if not always follows Q. Named the amount of new information in a message bits. Choice made from 2 equally likely possibilities. All communication can be thought of as information information can be measured in bits and all information should be thought of digitally. Viewed all information as the same. Everything has both an information capacity and information content. Something can never exceeds it’s information capacity but can fall short of its information content. Like the capacity of information passed in a football game has a ceiling but that doesn’t mean it will reach that ceiling in practice. So this trade off is a great yardstick to measure a transmission. Using error correcting codes could reduce error to as low as you want by raising the bar higher. Workers with the most patents often talked with Harry nyquist who was able to draw people out and have them investigate their own thinking more deeply and grow their own ideas further.

**Note:** Brilliant insight showing how more frequent data observation increases noise ratio - counterintuitive but crucial

> The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you are disproportionally likely to get (rather than the valuable part called the signal); hence the higher the noise to signal ratio. And there is a confusion, that is not psychological at all, but inherent in the data itself. Say you look at information on a yearly basis, for stock prices or the fertilizer sales of your father-in-law’s factory, or inflation numbers in Vladivostock. Assume further that for what you are observing, at the yearly frequency the ratio of signal to noise is about one to one (say half noise, half signal) —it means that about half of changes are real improvements or degradations, the other half comes from randomness. This ratio is what you get from yearly observations. But if you look at the very same data on a daily basis, the composition would change to 95% noise, 5% signal. And if you observe data on an hourly basis, as people immersed in the news and markets price variations do, the split becomes 99.5% noise to .5% signal. That is two hundred times more noise than signal —which is why anyone who listens to news (except when very, very significant events take place) is one step below sucker.  There is a biological story with information. I have been repeating that in a natural environment, a stressor is information. So too much information would be too much stress, exceeding the threshold of antifragility.

It has been very hard for me to explain that the more data you get, the less you know what’s going on, and the more iatrogenics you will cause. *** The noise bottleneck is really a paradox. We think the more information we consume the more signal we’ll consume. Only the mind doesn’t work like that. When the volume of information increases, our ability to comprehend the relevant from the irrelevant becomes compromised. We place too much emphasis on irrelevant data and lose sight of what’s really important.

I'm trying to craft better information flows. Almost every idea that you have is downstream from what you consume. We don't usually think about it that way but like when you choose who to follow on Twitter you're choosing your future thoughts in a sense you're creating the information flow what the timeline what the feed is going to look like or when you choose what book to read or which podcast episode to listen to you're choosing the thoughts that are going to arise. Now you may not necessarily know what they are but over time you can start to learn which sources of information are higher signal than others and I almost feel like that is like the main habit to try to build especially in our current modern society because information is overflowing and so widely accessible. The person who creates better information flows gets better thoughts.

> Shannon was a man of first principles and his information theory had 5 parts 
1. Information source 2. Transmitter that makes the initial source legible 3. Communication channel like air or wires 4. The receiver that gets the message and deconstructed 5. The person or thing the message is intended for and this all measured information known as the useful part of the signal. Something has high information content if it’s surprising or novel and low content if it’s expected a u after a q has almost 0 info content because u almost always follows q but the score of tomorrows game has some non zero and greater info content however when you watch it the information of the score post game provides almost no information to you if you have perfect memory. Information vs meaning. Information is just the novel 1 and 0 so will you marry me can be a 1 vs a complex legal doc which needs to encoded with many more bits but the signal through the noise of the first level of information is much higher. There is the carrying capacity of the information source as well as the message the capacity per second of a super computer is higher than a telegraph as long as your message is below the speed limit of the system using error correcting codes you can transmit messages with perfect fidelity but as long as you send more data ect to make up for the noise distraction you can transmit near perfect info. Turing and Shannon were friends and their work was complementary

Shane Parrish
This is full circle back to almost where we started, right? How important is that flow of information to finding the next opportunity, to capitalizing on other people's mistakes, to staying relevant?

Elad Gil
Yeah, there's two types of information. There's information that's hidden and there's information that... So I'll give you an example, when I started investing in generative AI, all these early foundation model things, etc., basically nobody was doing it. And it was all out in the open, right? GPT-3 had just dropped. It was clearly a big step function from two. If you just extrapolated that, you knew really, really interesting things were going to happen. People were using it internally in different ways at these companies. And so it was in plain sight that GPT-3 existed out there, but very few people recognized that it was that important. And so the question is why, right? The information was out there. There's other types of information that early access to helps impact how you think about the world. And sometimes that could just be a one-on conversation, or sometimes, again, they could be doing things out in the open. So for example, all the different things that Peter Thiel talked about and it cites on like 10 years ago ended up being true.

Shane Parrish
Not all, but a lot of them, right? So wait, let me go through some of these. So there's, I found information that is publicly available that you haven't found. There's, I weigh the information differently than you do. So I weigh the importance of it differently. And then there's access, where I have access to information that you don't have. Are there other types of information advantage?

Elad Gil
No, because I think the one where you interpret it differently that you mentioned has all sorts of aspects to that. Go deeper on that. Well, do you have the tooling to do it? Do you need a data scientist, right? It's all the algorithmic trading stuff. All the information's out there, but can you actually make use of it? There's, do you have the right filter on it? Do you pick up or glean certain insights or make intuitive leaps that other people don't? You know, there's all the different, it's sort of like when people talk about Richard Feynman, the physicist, and they said, with other physicists who won Nobel Prizes, they're like, Oh yeah, I could understand how that person got there. It's this chain of logical steps and maybe I could have done that. They're like, with Feynman, he just did these leaps and nobody knew how he did it. And so I do think there's people who uniquely synthesize information in the world and come to specific conclusions. And those conclusions are often right, but people don't know how they got there.

> Leverage in Investing and the Importance of Prudent Decision-making

Summary:
The use of leverage in investing is a cyclical process that is influenced by market conditions.

When things are going well, investors tend to view leverage positively, leading to increased interest in employing more leverage, relaxed regulations, and willingness from lenders to provide more. However, when events turn negative, the perception of leverage changes, leading to negative consequences for borrowers.

It is crucial to understand that leverage magnifies gains and losses, necessitating cautious decision-making to optimize, not maximize, its use.

Prudent use of leverage is essential to avoid ruin under extreme negative circumstances.

It is advised to use leverage based on cautious assumptions, especially when dealing with novel, risky, or volatile assets. The key to survival lies in maintaining a margin of safety and using less leverage with riskier assets. Conservative assumptions may limit gains but can safeguard financial well-being in challenging times, emphasizing the importance of avoiding excessive risk-taking in investing.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Attitudes that govern the use of debt capital are examples of this cyclical process. When things have been going well for a while, asset prices have been rising, investment returns have been positive, and the use of leverage has paid off in the form of higher returns, Investors view leverage as benign. As a result, the favorable aspects of leverage become well recognized. The negative potential is overlooked. Investors become interested in employing more. Lenders become willing to provide more, and regulations and moreays governing the use of leverage tend to become more permissive. But when events turn negative, this process goes into reverse. Leverage is penalized, not rewarded. Thus, it's used to clients. And importantly, lenders provide less and try to demand repayment of outstanding leverage if they can, leading to negative consequences for borrowers. In this way, as we so frequently see, psychology often strays from the happy medium and moves toward extreme highs, the presage painful losses when extreme lows are reached. The source of losses from excessive use of leverage might be best understood through an adaptation of my favorite new quote from Edward Chancellor's book The Price of Time, which I Cited in this past January's memo, Easy Money. The Manchester Banker, John Mills, commented perceptively in 1865 that, as a rule, panics do not destroy capital. They merely reveal the extent to which it has previously been destroyed by the taking on of excessive leverage in good times, using debt prudently. As with so many aspects of investing, determining the proper amount of leverage has to be a function of optimizing, not maximizing. Given that leverage magnifies gains when there are gains, and that investors only invest when they expect there to be gains, it can be tempting to think the right amount of leverage Is all you can get. But if you bear in mind, A, leverage is potential to magnify losses when there are losses, and B, the risk of ruin under extreme negative circumstances, investors should usually use Less than the maximum available. Successful investments, perhaps enhanced by the moderate use of leverage, should usually provide a good enough return. Having few people think about in good times. Here's how I summed it up in volatility plus leverage equals dynamite. Clearly, it's difficult to always use the right amount of leverage because it's difficult to be sure you're allowing sufficiently for risk. Leverage should only be used on the basis of demonstrably cautious assumptions. And it should be noted that if you're doing something novel, unproven, risky, volatile, or potentially life-threatening, you shouldn't seek to maximize returns. Instead, air on the side of caution. The key to survival lies in what Warren Buffett constantly harps on, margin of safety. Using 100% of the leverage one's assets might justify is often incompatible with assuring survival when adverse outcomes materialize. With the riskier the underlying assets, the less leverage should be used to buy them. Conservative assumptions on this subject will keep you from maximizing gains, but possibly save your financial life in bad times. The right way to think about debt may be best captured by one of the oldest maxims. There are old investors, and there are bold investors, but there aren't many old bold investors.

> Navigating Risk: The Balancing Act of Investment

Summary:
Investors face a fundamental trade-off between expected returns and associated risks, with the choice deeply influenced by individual circumstances and risk tolerance.

Each investor must determine their appropriate risk posture, considering factors like investment horizon, financial condition, and personal resilience to market fluctuations. This posture can either remain constant or vary according to market conditions, allowing for strategic shifts towards offense during downturns and defense during peaks.

Understanding the inherently uncertain nature of risk and return is crucial; as risk increases, potential returns also rise but so does the likelihood of adverse outcomes.

A more nuanced representation of this relationship highlights that higher risk not only involves higher expected returns but also broader ranges of possible outcomes, including severe losses.

This comprehension of risk dynamics is vital for effective investment strategies and is a significant contribution to investment theory.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
In a market with any degree of efficiency, that is, rationality, it's just a trade-off. A higher expected return with further upside potential at the cost of greater uncertainty, volatility, and downside risk, or a more dependable but lower expected return, entailing Less upside and less downside? The choice between the two is subjective, largely a function of the investor's circumstances and attitude toward bearing risk. That means the answer will be different for different investors. Choosing the offense-defense balance. I've previously expressed my view that, as a starting point, every investor or their investment manager should identify their appropriate normal risk posture or offense-defense Balance. For each individual or institution, this decision should be informed by the investor investment horizon financial condition income needs aspirations responsibilities and crucially Intestinal fortitude or their ability to stomach ups and downs once investors have specified the normal risk posture that's right for them, they face a choice. They can maintain that posture all the time, or they can opt to depart from it on occasion in response to the movements of the market and thus changes in the attractiveness of the offerings It provides, increasing their emphasis on offense when the market is beaten down, and on defense when it's riding high. Regardless of whether one's risk posture is fixed or variable, however, the next question is how one gets there. This question led me to think about another old idea, the relationship between risk and return. I've described a million times the way this was taught at the University of Chicago, beginning when I was there in the 1960s. It's a graphical presentation we've all seen ever since, in which, as we move from left to right, increasing the expected risk, the expected return also increases. As readers know, I always felt this representation was highly inadequate, since the linearity of the relationship in the graph makes it appear too certain that increased risk will Lead to increased return. This obviously belies the nature of risk. So, in a memo in 2006, I took the same line and superimposed on it some bell-shaped curves representing probability distributions turned on their side. I did this to indicate the uncertain nature of returns from riskier assets. Now we see that as the thing called risk increases, that is, as we move from left to right on the graph, not only does the expected return increase, but the range of possible outcomes becomes Wider and the bad outcomes become worse. That's risk. I hope this way of presenting risk will be considered a lasting contribution to the investment industry when I'm gone. Doodling one day, I took the black and green curves describing ownership asset returns and debt returns from figure four and added some intermediate positions in blue and red to indicate Various combinations of the two.

The focus should be on managing and minimizing losses rather than striving for a portfolio of only winners.

> Language is interesting because things map weirdly and tricky quirks of grammar that humans understand may take robots much longer. IBM Watson when competing in jeopardy deconstructed clues by word association and arrangement which was very similar to how humans did it and it won but it also came up with very quirky answers. Likewise a robot talking to robot program created complex meaning for spacial words like right and left while further developing a new language even the humans couldn’t understand. Language is confusing because there’s the word and the object language is just a comprehension model so just because you know how to use chair in a sentence you don’t really understand what it is other than a word. Language is just a descriptive model

**Note:** Excellent explanation of lossy compression in language communication and bandwidth limitations

> The limitations of communication through language

Summary:
The spectrum for information in the brain is much higher bandwidth than any given language. When I translate a thought into English, it is going through severe compression. And I am communicating that to another person for which they could misunderstand it. But we only have this lossy low bandwidth medium to communicate through with language.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
I had a very similar conversation recently where if two engineers send each other a pull request, it is exact what the communication is, like it is literally saying these are the instructions to a machine. Can you look at them to ensure that they are doing what this contract says that it should do? But if two people are having a conversation, at least this is my understanding, the brain's capability, the spectrum for information in the brain is much higher bandwidth than any given language. So when I translate a thought into English, it is going through severe compression. And I am communicating that to another person for which they could misunderstand it. Like a word could trigger a different emotion for someone else than I mean when I say it. And then they go through a decompression where they extrapolate that onto their brain. And it could light up a completely different set of neurons than was originally lit in my brain. But we only have this lossy low bandwidth medium to communicate through with language.

**Type:** semantics vs meaning  

**Note:** Frege's fundamental distinction between reference and meaning - crucial for understanding language limitations

> Frager split the idea of logic being true and something being true in someone’s mind psychological truths saying logic was the only truth. Truth value of a sentence is defined by its parts. Break down a sentence saying everyone loves someone does everyone love one person or do all one person love another at least one other person. Split ideas into reference if terms and the underlying meaning of terms. The reference value of the morning and evening star being the same can be true but the actually meaning part requires astrological knowledge they are both the same body Venus though. Some things are substitutable. The inter subsitutabily of truth values like a is round and b is round. In philosophy of language we can use different terms for the same concept but this doesn’t effect the actual thing being said. Focused on the deeper meaning not the actual word. Words vs deeper meaning.

> Philosophy of ordinary language. Philosophy isn’t science but more clarification. Create concepts and constructions but aware of the bounds of the science. Use language to understand human world and science to understand natural world. Map logical geography of concepts by tracing connections. Philosophical behaviorism states of mind aren’t apparent being observed but seen through behavior. You can’t see team spirit but concepts of the mind are observable in behavior. Close attention to language and how it relates to truth. Very semantic but logic is deeper and makes sense. Good concepts but not much life advice more logical optimization. Arguing meaning of words. Created meta and object language. Meta language of snow is white object language could be that in English French ect. Understanding a sentence requires understanding what can verify and falsify it. Theories of meaning and reference some language doesn’t need to be said like asking someone to close a door you can just close it instead of saying yes or if someone asks you if he’s fast and you say he has good spirit cooperative conversations to convey meaning. Names are rigid demonstrators they’re not essential to who someone is. Even if some aspects of a declaration are false the whole statement can be true. Aristotle can still be Aristotle if he didn’t teach Alexander the Great. Words are rough descriptors. Split words and the essence of words they don’t need 100% overlap. Words not the same as meaning.

Reading tips
1. Constantly think about the authors use of language, argument, meaning of words.
2. Visualize the events from the book
3. Think ahead and make predictions
4. Discuss with friends
Further learning tips
1. Be openminded and skeptical
2. Observe carefully

> History the map isn’t the territory. Human commonalities like love and grief pleasure and pain are innate in humans. Human nature remains constant. We project our current time on the past in trying to understand them. The reading in problem there isn’t enough info so we need to make assumptions which invites bias with no justification. We have no clue why Stonehenge exists but we read in and assume it’s religious. One issue is research funded by biased institutions leads to biased research like money coming from a religiously minddd institution. Another is the lamp light problem we can only look for non perishable society but most of society is perishable. What are we missing. Modern human behavior uses symbolic thought to create thinks like ornament tool making art funeral practices. Symbolic communication is a big step forward for humanity and happened among maybe Neanderthals too. Tough to tell if this was an anatomic or social but using symbols like language enabled societal complexity. Due to new techniques archeology is becoming more scientific. Archeology is about attributing meaning and making sense. Defensibility open to refutation and contradiction with better arguments. There is only one method and that is to be intelligent. All other methods are serving that purpose. Just do what best serves the truth seeking. Knowledge needs logic means and careful methods to prove itsekd. .

> Deliberate practice isn’t everything, but if you want to keep improving at a skill or overcome a plateau, you’ll benefit from incorporating the principles mentioned in this article. To recap:  Deliberate practice means practicing with a clear awareness of the specific components of a skill we’re aiming to improve and exactly how to improve them. The more we engage in deliberate practice, the greater our capabilities become. Our minds and bodies are far more malleable than we usually realize. Deliberate practice is structured and methodical. Deliberate practice is challenging because it involves constantly pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. Deliberate practice requires constant feedback and measurement of informative metrics—not vanity metrics. Deliberate practice works best with the help of a teacher or coach. Continuing deliberate practice requires a great deal of intrinsic motivation. Deliberate practice requires constant, intense focus. Deliberate practice leverages the spacing effect—meaning a consistent commitment over time is crucial. If you’re content with your current level of skill or just doing something for fun, you don’t necessarily need to engage in deliberate practice Deliberate practice is best suited to pursuits where you’re actively aiming for a high level of performance or to break beyond some kind of supposed limit.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
I always found that hours zero to four or five are the frustration barrier. Like that's the worst part of the whole process. You're just frustrated. You can't do it. You know, you can't do it. Something starts to change between hours four and six, where you start to see yourself being able to perform in a way that you've never been able to perform before. And that's where things start to get really interesting. And then by and there's there's some variation here, but between hours 10 to 20, for me, two things happen. One is that you know you're a lot more competent now than you were when you like the improvement is night and day clear. And that's also where I find the frustration really to a great extent goes away. So continuing to practice after that point is way easier than it was at the beginning. Like you've reached a basic level of competence. You know what you're doing. You're no longer so confused. You're in a place where you're still making mistakes, but you also know enough about what you're doing that you can notice when you make a mistake and then correct it. And it's that part of the process, like having a certain level of skill, having a lack of frustration and being able to self correct as you practice, that's what gets you from pretty good to really good over a longer period of time. But it's that early critical period that really makes or breaks the skill to begin with.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Never called it survival but i know that that was underneath it of like getting directly to unfiltered the best information i had a friend who was the chief of staff to a ceo of a billion

Speaker 2
Dollar company before he assumed this role he sort of said you know i think by and large i know i'm paraphrasing here so these aren't his exact words, but these guys make incredibly stupid Decisions. And I want to help change that. And then he got up there and he's like, actually, they make really good decisions with the information they have. They just have completely terrible information because it's been so filtered by the time it got up to the CEO's office. And so he started this thing where he just started calling the person that he could get in touch with closest to the problem to understand the problem and having briefs from that person And skipping like five layers or six layers of management. And he got in so much trouble for this. I just think that's like a fascinating thing when you think about like, how do we sift what's important from what's not? And some of the variables you mentioned are like getting closer to the information, getting unfiltered information, going direct to people who have experience. And if you think about this in the context of learning, I also think it's fascinating because I think of learning as a loop. There's like, you have an experience, consider that like the 12 hand on a clock you reflect on that experience which is the three hand you create a compression or abstraction which you Can think of as the distillation as the six and then you have an action so you have this loop that constantly feeds back into itself often what we're consuming is other people's compressions And when we do the book summary is a great great example of that, right? You're consuming somebody else's, you don't know what's missing. You don't know how they formulated it. Often they don't have direct experience in the thing that they're even summarizing. And so they're not able to capture the essence of something. Their distillation works for them because they did the work on the raw end and you feel like it works for you as a person. But when you go to put it in practice, it doesn't work. The experience is like this thing that's, you know, like four gigabytes, right? Of memory occupying in your brain. So your brain sort of like, we're going to compress this into something much smaller. That's the reflection angle. You're sorting what matters from what doesn't. You're sort of like decompressing the emotions from things. You're determining what are the variables that govern the situation going forward? How do they interact across time? What are the models that sort of carry the weight here? And then you come to this compression, but you can go back from that compression to the experience. Whereas somebody who consumed just that compression can't go back to the experience. And the way that I try to explain this to my kids, as imperfect as this is, is they, every Sunday we have this cookie recipe and I make them make cookies before they can have the wifi password. So I leave the recipe on the counter. And you know, when they follow the recipe, the cookies turn out amazing. And when they don't follow it exactly, they have no idea what went wrong. Now the chef or the baker who created that recipe would instantly be able to look at a photo probably or take a bite of the cookie and they would know instantly what went wrong. Did they heat the butter too much? Did they not melt it enough? Did they compact the sugar too much? Was the oven running a little hot? And you know, even though it said 360 degrees was at 375, but the baker, they would know that. And you want to surround yourself when you're trying to acquire information with bakers, right? And you want to be the baker, but you can't be the baker in everything. So you have to pick your discipline going back to what game are you playing? Where am I going to be a master and where can I borrow and just crib from other people? Because by borrowing and cribbing the compressions, I'm going to get to average really quickly. I love that. Two thoughts on that.

Speaker 1
One is if they were making the cookies and following the recipe, if they wrote it down at each step, what they were actually doing, that gives you something to look back. Like, let's say the cookies didn't turn out well, right? It gives you something to look back at and go and track and see kind of where they might have been off. And then the second part of that, just to the point of having a blueprint and the importance of that is you start with the recipe and you do it, you know, exactly, but then you adapt it. You're like, well, maybe if I put, I really like walnuts or whatever. Chocolate chips. I'm going to put some chocolate chips in this. And then you try that. And the first time you do it, it may not work that well, but I still really like chocolate chips. That's authentic to me. And so you adapt it a little bit. And then in the end, you end up with something that's uniquely you and really special. Totally. And now I want cookies.

Speaker 2
Fry me for cookies. Talk to me about the will to win versus the will to practice. It's nice to have that goal, that aspiration.

Speaker 1
It's very different to have the will to practice, to grind, to make the cookies every day, and to write it out. Then look back at yourself and look at the steps and measure yourself and showing up in that. And that's why I also tie it just to the concept of it is the journey that gets you to that place. One of the questions that I really love, I think about, and I'm still evolving on is music. If you're a concert pianist, even though you're one of the best musicians in the world, you practice your scales every day. For us as investors, what's the equivalent of practicing scales every day? It's an interesting question. I think there's some parts of it that are temperament related, like just practicing deferred gratification. There's elements of it that are thinking about the world probabilistically, everything, just continuing to practice that every day or the uncertainty of a situation, but not taking That for granted and really practicing that day after day, essentially inoculate yourself to prepare yourself for that.

Speaker 2
It's interesting because as you were saying that, part of what popped in my head was if we go back and we look at the grades in sports, because that's an easy reference, but I talked to somebody Who played with Tom Brady and they basically said practice was a game. And if you talk to somebody who played with MJ, it's like practice was a game. You're not coasting. And if you are, calling you out and like um and kobe was the same way where they treat the practice like they would treat a game with the same respect the same effort the same dedication The same frustration if they don't make a play they don't sort of like half-ass it and expect to win on game day when they don't do it in the practice how do you instill that mindset in your Kids? Like where the will to practice, the will to grind, the consistency, the routine or ritual of it and taking pleasure in that and not the outcome.

This allows for more insightful conversations and better decision-making, even in areas outside your core expertise. Dont expect it to be easy it’s the hardest at the beginning. The ground work is the hardest and it’s built at the beginning and compounds over time. When you win in the weeds you compound faster. Have a larger narrative about where you’re going is what keeps you going make yourself the hero of your story this is what fires you through in your darkest times.

> Enhancing Conscientiousness Through Online Learning

Summary:
The availability of online resources like Khan Academy has increased the importance of conscientiousness in learning.

To enhance conscientiousness, design and UI modifications can emulate traditional motivators like in-person deadlines and peer interaction. In education psychology, it is noted that engaging in deep cognitive work can hinder metacognition, making it hard to plan, regulate, and evaluate learning progress.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
Okay, so a brighter question is now that we have all these online resources, some of which you have helped develop Khan Academy and elsewhere, it seems that the value of conscientiousness As a trait has dramatically increased. If you can motivate yourself to learn these things, the world is out there for you to absorb. What are the sort of design or UI or even content modifications that can be made to give you a conscientiousness boost, where in the past, you have a professor, you have peers, you have In-person deadlines that motivate you, is there something equivalent to a pen and paper, how that boosts your mathematical IQ for conscientiousness?

Speaker 1
Right, so one enduring result in education psychology is that when you're doing a lot of cognition, metacognition is difficult. So what I mean by that is like when you're thinking really hard about the stuff on the page, it's very difficult for you to like plan, regulate yourself, figure out what the best next action To do, is reflect and evaluate whether you're understanding things, all the stuff that we're talking about,

**Note:** Comprehensive framework for accelerated learning: Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencing, and Stakes - demonstrates systematic approach to learning by doing

> Efficient Learning Framework

Summary:
The key framework for efficient learning consists of four main steps: Deconstruct, Selection, Sequencing, and Stakes.

Deconstruction involves breaking down the subject matter into constituent parts with expert guidance. Selection focuses on choosing key material and method to focus on.

Sequencing is essential for learning in a logical order, emphasizing the importance of proper progression.

Stakes add a compelling positive or negative consequence for hitting or missing the learning goal, which drives motivation and focus.

This framework can be applied not only to learning a specific subject but also to meta-learning, teaching how to learn effectively by walking through the process, providing examples, and setting up projects for practical application. Leveraging tools like chat GPT can further enhance the learning process, enabling faster understanding and application of concepts.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
If you had to condense down that meta-learning chapter, what do you think the key framework is? I can explain it. I'm happy to explain it.

Speaker 1
I use it all the time for everything imaginable. The process is as follows. You can abbreviate the framework as D-I-S-S-S. The I is omitted. It's just to make a vowel in there. D is deconstruct. Then you have selection. Then you have sequencing. Then you have stakes. There are ways that all these can be used independently, but I like to use them in this sequence. Deconstruct simply means you're taking learn X, learn tennis, learn Japanese, learn archery, learn tango, whatever it is. You're breaking it down with the help of experts, hopefully, into some constituent parts. Then you have selection, let's just say, in the case of any of these things, you're doing an 80-20 analysis. If I could only choose 20% of each of these categories or 20% of the categories, and this is, let's just say, for the first month of practice, what should I focus on? Great. Talk to some experts, and you'll be able to figure that out. This is very important because selection, for instance, with vocabulary for languages, English has 300,000, 400,000. English has very high volume for words compared to many different languages. But if you take something like Japanese, I speak Japanese, Spanish, and a couple others, you can, with say, 1500 words be conversationally fluent and able to read most things in terms Of frequency of appearance. So you want to select your material first and then your method. The material beats method every time. So material over method is another principle. Put another way, what you do matters more than how you do it. I think that's something people would find most shocking about me if they were to observe me for a day. They'd be like, this guy gets nothing done in most days. But the things I get done tend to be very high leverage or a lead domino that knocks over other dominoes. So I choose the things I do very well. As for method, I'm often a sloppy mess, if I'm honest. Then sequencing, this is putting things in a logical order so that you are learning in the proper order. For instance, I didn't learn to swim until I was in my 30s. And I grew up on Long Island, keep in mind. I had a couple of near drowning experiences and I just swore off water, basically. And nothing worked. None of the coaching sessions, training sessions, teachers, I tried worked until I found something called total immersion and total immersion exemplifies this process brilliantly. Total immersion swimming basically has you practice hydrodynamic positions before you ever practice breathing or strokes. So you're kicking off the side of the pool in the shallow end so you can just stand up experimenting with being like few sludge right position, few sludge left position, getting your Body in the proper position so that you're not wasting 90% of your energy trying to propel yourself on top of the water, all of which is wrong for most people. So the sequencing, putting things in a logical sequence is really, really key. And you can get expert help, you can experiment, you can try to do things out of order. If you want a competitive advantage, I've done that before. Selection, for instance, for purposes of tango, like I ended up setting a world record in tango and going to the world championships and stuff in 2004, 2005, because I looked at what Teachers were teaching, what they claimed was important. And then I reviewed competition footage and looked at sort of the characteristic techniques and patterns and so on of the dancers I thought I could emulate. And there was this huge discrepancy between what was being taught and what was actually being performed in competition. And so I just honed in on selecting certain things to emulate in teachers who had similar body. You would have been a good quant investor. You're basically describing good quants. Yeah. And so I had this handheld, this is the four smartphones. I would review and categorize all my footage at night. It was very involved. But that was with primarily deconstruction and selection in that tango example. Then the sequencing, logical sequence, a lot of folks who think that they're battle languages, you're not battling, it's just that you've never had someone do this, run the language Through these filters properly. Stakes, there must be a consequence, positive or negative for hitting your goal and not hitting your goal. And it needs to be really compelling. And if you do that, a lot of these other things fall in line.

Speaker 2
So if you've gotten good at this process, which is so interesting and compelling, what is the equivalent process of being so good at then repackaging and teaching it faster than you Learned it? Is it just a better appreciation of that same process and a better framing of that same process to others and a better Pareto understanding or something like that that helps you do that So effectively? Is it clever copy? Is it clever framing? What is it that unlocks such good teaching for yourself or others?

Speaker 1
Let's just assume I have a student in front of me. There are really two things I can teach. One is a given subject matter, tango, charcoal drawing, whatever it might be. I would use this process or the output of this process to teach them and then probably set up some stakes. And then the second thing I can teach, so there's the subject, or I can teach meta learning, learning how to learn, in which case I would walk them through this process and give them examples Just like I'm doing with you. And then I would have them test it. I would give them projects. I'd be like, okay, this week you're learning this, next week you're learning this, week after you're learning this. If you know how to apply this now, holy shit man with chat GPT, another tool zero disposal. Perplexity is really good.

Speaker 2
Have you tried that? Have you tried to say like, this is the way I like to learn, here's my method, give me the deconstruction, give me the parade of distribution of what matters. Have you tried using a systems to do this faster?

Speaker 1
Yeah, you have to get really good with the spell casting with prompts to make it conform to this because the machines aren't going to necessarily understand the terminologies I'm using Them. But I know people who have learned to code video edit in next to no time using just chat GPT. All of that is going to 10x in the next six months, and then the next six months.

All their fundamental assumptions were wrong. It was painful but they had to pivot their entire strategy or die. Learn to see value and eliminate waste. Learning is the unit of progress for start ups don’t build products you don’t need to but build what you have to to get the feedback you need. AB testing and validated learning. Figure out what’s actually happening. Productivity is systematically figuring out what you need to build. Having 0 revenue is better than having a little bit. Get data and strong feedback loops. Don’t use theatrics and pr but validated learning to iterate and develop the product. Break down the business plan into component parts and run experiments on each. Think big start small and scale. Run experiments and learn as you scale. Get real customer data and learn their problems. Figure out black swans too. Don’t guess and plan. Test key hypothesis small and iterate. If it’s failing investigate and pivot. Success is learning how to solve a customers problem

> Heuristics step by step approach to problem solving coming up with guesses and adjusting to get closer to the truth. Step by step approach finding the best models was analogous to human reasoning. Learning through coherent self reinforcing structures of a cluster is coherent and stable enough it could serve as a basis for things at a bigger level these coherent structures and building blocks on building blocks formed a good basis for a general theory of systems. Breaking big things into small things then building from there like program functions is an easier way to build. Divide and conquer and once you know basic building blocks you can abstract further like a red fire truck. Once tit understand those basic things you can fit that model into your worldview. Adaptive systems instead of going step by step can reshuffle completely and create giant leaps of knowledge. So of you can discover the 10 building blocks and see how it’s arranged you get closer to the truth be seeing and testing their interactions. In programming you want to create the right instructions in the right order but if you don’t know the right order you can use a guided search of genetic algorithm that tries to maximize an output function. Reproduction and cross over lead to efficiency in knowledge growth

Idea of justice and balance between the substances such that there were balancing loops to keep the world in equal proportions was a core Greek belief. Had an idea that everything evolved from that substance and that even humans evolved from fishes with intermediate steps. Mylesesns had ideas of the world being a cylinder and had different scientific beliefs about air elements and the cosmos. Pythagorean’s were part weird religion part science and geometry. Part mystic part math. He saw all life even animals as sacred and knowledge and property as shared saw the disinterested observer as the peak of humanity seeking truth with no stake. Some people are spectators some are actors in the play then the disinterested investigators sit atop. Pythagoras saw all things as numbers his religion was rooted in part pseudoscience part real science. Pythagoras came up with the idea of going from axioms things we know that are true to conclusions based on those axioms and connections that can then be axioms. Math is a thing that is objectively true the world of thought cleaner than the world of atoms. You can create perfection. These creates idea for objective deep truth in other places like politics but also a great way to structure argument through axioms. Thr idea of objective truth lead to beliefs in Jesus.

> We must start with a theory not observations. Observation is selective if you say observe that doesn’t mean anything you need an object of observation just telling a room of people to observe means nothing. Dogmatism the strength of a belief is in its repetition and regularity not in its conjecture and criticism. Dogma is the resistance for change and to continue to see the world through a specific lense without questioning or criticizing. Dogma seeks to verify while criticism thinks to disprove. Induction is no valid we must seek to criticize and falsify not confirm beliefs. We must accept that our beliefs are the best we have to go on but at the same time understanding that they’re likely some degree of false. Accept that with new evidence we’re likely to disprove even are closest held theories and be open to that fact in our search for knowledge. Science should aim at low probability explanations that are so specific and expose their self to falsifying that they have predictive power general theories that can’t be proved wrong don’t tell us much about the world. High probability bets provide lower pay offs than lower ones that are more specific but provide greater leverage and knowledge gain in the world.

Science starts from problems not observations. The key aspect of science is conscious application of the critical method. Previous conjectures were evolutionary and sought to be validated now we seek to disprove our conjectures to grow our knowledge base. We don’t validate thought processes but conclusion. Science is the critical approach of criticizing and falsifying beliefs constantly as a default. Start with problems then critical approach 2 steps then new problems. We learn through falsification and falsification is a scientific success. Science grew from critical discussion. Good science must be falsifiable if it can never be proved wrong it isn’t science. We seek to make bold conjectures because that allows us to learn more with lower probability predictions. Better predictions predict more things are false. Saying there are no white ravens predicts less than saying there are only black ravens because that rules out every other color

> Astrology vs astronomy - theory’s that prove true in every instance are false because they are so general as to make no prediction. Good theories are specific and hard to vary. Better theories take more risk with the specificity of their prediction and a general theory that proves everything is unscientific not very good. Theories should be falsifiable based on the predictions they make and instead of trying to confirm a theory we should try to falsify it to improve it. Freudian psychology proves all behavior Einsteinian physics can only function in a specific world. Good theories are very easily and clearly testable and refutable if they’re false and we should seek to prove them wrong. Another bad science move is to slightly alter a theory once it’s proven wholly wrong to fit the history that occurred. This makes it pseudoscience. Predicting this is the year given the roster and schedule doing a game by game analysis is scientific but when each game goes the other way blaming it on wind and bad luck while maintaining the overarching thesis is bad science. Make specific predictions before the event. There are elements to pseudoscience that are correct but we should reject them not their conclusions forever though. Astrology was a bad science but the fact that the tides and planet alignment effect the earth is actually valid. Bad science but conclusion right. Myths can underly future science. Demarcation - finding a criterion for the scientific. Verifiable and testable. Nothing can be proved or disproved based on observation.

The best communicators are the best listeners who know what the audience wants most and tailors the conversation that way. The stories you tell and the way to tell them depend on your audience. You should read others reactions as you speak listen as you speak and then ask them if they enjoy the topic or want to move on. We can be taught about being wrong but we can never be wrong about what we like and dislike

> True salvation is to be who you are feel that all in the present moment. You find god in the here and now and you can always get there by realizing you’re there already you find god by realizing you don’t need to seek it that you’ve reached it. Until you’re present all relationships are flawed. Negativity and positivity in a relationship are 2 sides of the same coin true happiness in relationship only come from presence. If your love has an opposite it isn’t love but an ego based attachment you can’t find happiness in a relationship before you find it in yourself. Addictions arise from refusal to face your pain whether it be drugs or relationships. You need to be present to avoid pain and solve it internally you can’t run from it it’ll always catch you. Happiness comes from stopping judgement and accepting what is this is the key to happiness. Stop judging or changing people accept them this transcends ego. Love is deep within you and every other creature realizing this and seeing it in others is being with god the eternal one life. Exclusively is ego not love but love can be stronger with people. Even in bad relationships sometimes in intense emotional moments pain body will subside and you’ll feel fully present. True communication is communion this renders the mind powerless and reveals your being. Mind and mind identification don’t make you yourself but a mental image of yourself that you’re projecting and concealing but not really living and being. Crisis breeds opportunity but we can’t live and fall further into crisis we can’t escape our problems we must confront them or we’ll remain trapped. When you know there is disharmony and you can accept or deny it acceptance leads to freedom. Don’t remain trapped. When you know you’re unhappy and you hold that then you realize it cannot remain there it’s just a matter of time. When you know you’re not at peace you surround this feeling with love. Transform into peace. You cannot transform yourself or your partner with inner transformation just create a space for grace and love to enter.

We cannot find happiness through acts but only through being can we achieve happiness. Happiness is the feeling of contribution to others. One needs to have freedom which is the key to happiness and avoids relying on the recognition of others. Being of use is all that matters. We must have the courage to be normal. Life isn’t a line but a series of discrete dots. Life is a series of discrete moments and cannot really be planned no matter how much we’d want to do so life is constant discrete moments that come together but can only be lived moment to moment.

> Happiness Flourishes from Enjoyment, Satisfaction, and Purpose

Summary:
Happiness is defined not merely as a fleeting feeling but as a state characterized by three essential components: enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose.

Enjoyment transcends simple pleasure, requiring shared experiences that create lasting memories. Satisfaction is linked to achieving goals, providing a sense of joy and fulfillment.

Purpose extends beyond personal aspirations to encompass a broader, transcendental understanding of life, offering meaning and direction.

The happiest individuals find peace and perspective by focusing on something larger than themselves.

Those who lack happiness often become preoccupied with self-focused concerns, which is detrimental to their well-being. Emphasizing these three macro nutrients can significantly enhance one’s happiness span.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
What's happiness? They'll say, it's that feeling I get on Thanksgiving and, you know, yada, yada, yada, feelings, feelings that have wrong. Happiness is not a feeling anymore than your Thanksgiving dinner is the smell of the turkey. The feeling of happiness is evidence of happiness. Now we measure happiness in all sorts of very complicated and very simple ways. And one of the things that we know is that all of the people who are really happy who have a lot of happy feelings, but also have a lot of satisfaction content with their lives, they're getting Abundance and balance across three dimensions. And so this is the definition of happiness. Now think about this. Like if I were to say, hey, Peter, what is the Thanksgiving dinner? You'd say, well, carbohydrates, proteins and fat, you know, you'd say there's the three macro nutrients of all food. And you know, we're always trying to get our macros in order. Forget lifespan. Let's talk about health span. And I say, let's take it even farther to happiness span. So let's get our literal macro nutrients in order for health span. Let's get our happiness span in order with the macro nutrients of happiness. They are enjoyment, satisfaction and purpose. Those are the three macro nutrients of happiness. If you don't have those things and balance and abundance, you will not report being a happy person. Now this is different than unhappiness, which is another entire subject. Believe it or not, happiness and unhappiness are not opposites. They're different phenomena. So we're just talking about happiness here to be a truly happy person. You need to enjoy your life. And that requires not pleasure. It's pleasure plus elevation is pleasure plus metacognition. You know, Thanksgiving dinner fills your belly and tastes good. That's pleasure. But the experience that you have of consuming the Thanksgiving dinner with other people and having a memory that you can last forever, that's enjoyment. And so it's a much more elevated experience than pleasure satisfaction, which is super fleeting and troublesome and, you know, as Mick Jagger saying, I can't get no satisfaction. The truth is you can't keep no satisfaction. There's an entire research literature on that that I've participated in on the problem with satisfaction, but it's the joy and reward for a job well done and a goal met, you know, that Elation from actually meeting a goal. And last but not least is purpose is meaning in life. I talk an awful lot about the coherence, the significance, the direction, the meaning of meaning and it gets back to a lot of the great philosophy, but we can also measure it. I have a few diagnostic questions that I ask for the claims who come to me and they'd lack purpose in their life. The questions I ask are, why were you born and for what are you willing to die? And if you can't answer one or both of those questions, you have a serious meaning problem. We got to dig in and actually dissolve that particular problem. But that's it. I mean, these are the three macro nutrients, the protein carbohydrates and fat of happiness are enjoyment, satisfaction and purpose.

Speaker 2
There's so much I want to touch on there. I'll start with the latter. I have to be honest with you and I've thought about this a lot. In terms of purpose, I literally can only think of one thing and I suspect a lot of people will think of this, which is kids. I think that's probably the only thing I would say I have a real purpose for that I would die for in a second and think nothing of. Is it bad that I don't have a higher purpose than that?

Speaker 1
It sort of depends on what the higher purpose means. One of the things that you find is that one of the habits of the happiest people, think of this as the dishes and the happiness meals, suppose that the macro nutrients and the happiness Meal, the happiest people, they all have a transcendental understanding of life. It's just to say that they have an understanding of life bigger than themselves. The most miserable people, the people who lack happiness and have a lot of unhappiness, they're focusing on me, me, me, me. The philosophers talk about the I self and the me self and the I self is outward looking its observational as sort of zen. The me self is reflective of the outside world. It has a lot to do with social comparison. It has a lot to do with the micro circumstances. My job, my money, my career, my friends, my house, my mortgage, my commute, me, me. It's just so boring. And a transcendental understanding of life is key to a happy life because you need peace. You need perspective. You need to zoom out when the Dalai Lama says you are one in seven billion. What he's saying is not that you're insignificant or you're the spec. What he's saying is that you need to stop focusing on yourself so you can actually get some relief once in a while. So that might be the higher purpose, but it's just a transcendental purpose and understanding of something bigger than yourself. So that's another thing. And I know you have that. I know you think about things that are bigger than you. And part of that is your family and part of that's your kids. But part of that is an understanding of the universe.

> Nitzche wasn’t anti semetic his sister was and published his book posthumously with a nazi tilt. She was a nazi. He was curious about the ethical questions that shape your life how should you live and what sort of person should you be. Ethics concerns character where morals concerns actions. Who should I be vs what should I do. Declares god is dead and the entire Christian society has no basis. Need to reevaluate everything and perverted what humanity could be. What was good used to be defined by high minded people but this was upended by a revolt promoted by resentment. Good bad contrast of aristocracy replaced with good vs evil pride with humility. Self denial and sacrifice are virtues. What is good heightens power or feeling of power in man what is bad is born from weakness happiness is growth of power not contentness but desire for more power. Fitness over virtue. Will to overcome frustration to exist so one can create and succeed to strive and desire is the ethical way. Striving and overcoming desire and achieves growth and expansion makes you a Superman. To be a Superman you must be a yes sayer and affirm life as if you could do whatever you wanted. Life as positively and nobly but also requires embracing suffering and grief with courage. Don’t live under illusions but choose happiness when you embrace life. Art is the great beauty of the world. Treat our own life as art and live creatively as autonomous individuals. Be poets of our lives. Reject conventional morality. Revalues old values. Destroy old values and revalue them.

The fear of death keeps us repressed and ingrained by society but if we lose this we free ourselves. The other says men understand death as a worm at our core and live with the knowledge that it haunts our entire life. Fear of death is universal anxiety and threat to our self preservation. Fear of death is our core anxiety and it’s constantly repressed but under everything. Man may have evolved so the most paranoid survived. Repression lives on life energy. Fears get absorbed by striving for more life. When we move with that power we get contentment we move toward more absorbing activity. We also avoid needless distractions when we do this ignoring the fear of death losing it in our deep focus. Organism works against fragility through full expression of life in their experience. We develop a sense of narcissism and this increases when we feel special. We get power from repression. When we live an assured life we become more powerful and narcissistic but this gives us power to live our lives. Narcissism gives us power and faith in ourselves. Growing up is the giving over of life’s project. He lives uncritically and accepts world program. Doesn’t think about life just does what he’s supposed to do. He learns to adapt and not stand out. He doesn’t fear he lives the program life until he can no longer do so and then he has a psychotic break. Then the fear of death comes back we can no longer repress it. Many ways repression works to calm man. Man is most free and safe when he becomes dependent on the world and gives up his agency. Is fear of death nature or nurture.

> Crafting Positive Narratives for Personal Growth

Summary:
Crafting positive narratives about oneself, such as changing from a limiting story to a empowering one, can help in personal growth and development.

By rewriting personal stories from memory and listening to them, individuals can rewire their brain's neural pathways. Engaging in handwriting these stories has been found to be more powerful than typing on a computer.

Through the process of narrative crafting, confidence, belief, and success can be cultivated.

Writing, through methods like journaling, not only helps in reflecting but also leads to new idea generation and deeper understanding.

Many historical figures have used writing as a tool for personal development. Journaling can transform one's mindset, turning challenging days into opportunities for growth and learning.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
He's at the University of Texas. And I mean, it's incredible the kind of success on the protocols he's had in helping people overcome trauma with their hand, with writing, with writing skills. But we found that creating the story that works for you with your hand and rewriting it several times from memory and then reading it and even using the voice memo on your phone where you Actually tell yourself over the phone, your voice memo capability, and then you play it back and you listen to yourself coaching you. It's not having someone from the outside coaching you with their public voice. You are taking your private voice and making it public and now listening to it and trying to get a new way of having these neural pathways in your brain transfer information. And eventually, over time, the story begins to change. So it might be, I hate putting. I've never been a good putter in sport. And if I could just be a great putter, I would be on the PGA tour list and one of the top guys or women. But and then the story you tell yourself is I just don't seem to have the ability to be a good putter. I've always had trouble putting and I think this is my greatest never. So I say that you can't get there with that story. That story is so limiting. Here's the story that works for you. At this point in my life, the truth is if you look at my stats and one of the poor putters on the PGA tour or the LPGA tour, that's true. But I'm an athlete and I have to tell you, one day I'm going to become one of the best putters, if not the best putter, on tour. And I'll tell you why, because I am going to devote more energy, more effort. I'm going to make this the most important part of my game. And I'm going to love doing it. And every time I see a green, I'm going to light up and say, ah, fantastic. I have another chance to practice my putting and to get it right. And if I miss a putter, three footer for a birdie, I'll simply say, thank God I got that out of my system. Now I'm going to get better. And so you develop a running kind of narrative with yourself that builds confidence, builds belief, builds this and you start by crafting the perfect story with your hand. And the more your hand works, and that actually what we found, James Pinabaker hasn't found this though. But with our data collection, we found that it's more powerful to do it by hand than it is on a computer. And so we have everybody do it, you can print it, or you can cursive writing, however you want to do it. But we prefer that you do it by hand and each new iteration you do from memory. And then you compare with the last one. And then those that you're putting new energy into this network where stories are told around putting or around your marriage or around your intelligence, your confidence. And that's what we've done over the years. We've had so many astonishing successes. And I had no idea any of this was going to surface. It all took years of practice and data collection to refine it. And I feel very grateful to have had that opportunity, what I call a living lab for helping distill a lot of the mysteries of how this miraculous human system is engineered.

Speaker 2
I love the nature of writing. We encourage that with sort of decision journals and as the means by which we can reflect or one of the ways by which we can reflect. And one of the ways which we can learn to think as well. So not only do we discover through writing that we don't know what we're talking about always, but we discover new ideas and we come to a new understanding. It's so powerful as a form. And if you look through it history, most of the people who would we would consider the grades of history at one point or another have journaled.

Speaker 1
I completely agree. And it was something that I started with after learning about this with a lot of our clients and so forth. I started journaling and I mean I get up in the morning and I have to do it. It's almost like an addiction now. And I try to program my day and look at all the things. And when anybody asked me, you know, how am I feeling today? My response is if I'm feeling a little foggy and I have a headache or whatever, I'll say, you know, I have a little have a few things that are bothering, but I got to tell you, I'm excited About having another opportunity to push the needle to learn a little bit more. I'm grateful for this day. And if you put that down in writing, something magical happens is I could change the whole kind of template, the screen, the mindset you have for, you know, dealing with all the storms That you were inevitably going to face all day long. So it doesn't become a nightmare day. And that's it's a wonderful lesson. I'm a such a believer in journaling.

> The Connection Between Enclosed Cognition and Performance

Key takeaways:
- Kobe Bryant had a unique approach to preparing for games by communing with his mental game inside a cage
- Clothed cognition can enhance performance by associating certain traits with specific attire
- Creating rituals by combining routine/habit with storytelling can add meaning to actions
- Kobe Bryant's alter ego, the Mamba, faced trash talk to protect his mental wellbeing

Transcript:
Speaker 1
We'd build a cage and that thing lives inside the cage. And then they would open the cage and then the thing gets unleashed. Kobe was different in that he wanted to commune with it. So he got into the cage with it. And that's all the mental thing that's happening in the locker room before going out onto the court. And there's that trigger that's happening. And the great thing about triggers in the book I talk about in clothed cognition. And what in clothed cognition is is because I have a story about what it means to have a white doctor's coat on. You're detailed, you're methodical, you're careful, you're smart. If I actually put on a doctor's coat, I will enclose my cognitive traits in the abilities of smart, detailed, methodical and careful. Now, if I'm about to go do something that demands being careful and methodical and detailed, I've just elevated my performance, my ability to go and execute that because of wearing The thing. So for me, it was wearing a pair of non prescription glasses when I was 22 years old because I felt like I had a baby face. I looked like I was 12. It was getting in the way of me even believing that I was credible. And so I went and bought a pair of non prescription glasses for my alter ego, Super Richard, so I could step into a new identity that wasn't so worried about rejection. And Super Richard was specifically hired to do sales calls because I wasn't doing them. I was good at coaching, but I just wasn't good at promoting myself. So those rituals are, rituals is when routine or habit meets storytelling because that's meaning. It's not Kobe that's getting trash talk, it's the mamba that's getting trash talk now when it goes into the arenas and everyone's got these slurred chants because he's someone who's Just an abuser or whatever the case was. We had to create that for his own mental wellbeing.

> Storytelling Principles and Self-Reflection

Summary:
The inner voice we possess plays a crucial role in shaping our destiny and it is essential to ensure that the stories we tell ourselves are empowering rather than limiting.

To understand the impact of our self-narratives, we must first question if our stories are aligned with reality and if they resonate with the best version of ourselves. Additionally, it is important to evaluate if our stories lead us towards our desired goals, inspire optimism, and reinforce our capabilities.

By deliberately crafting narratives that mirror our values and aspirations, we can positively influence our mindset and actions.

Encouraging self-reflection on the stories we tell ourselves can guide us to navigate life more effectively and create a future that aligns with our true potential.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
But the more we have learned about the power of this inner voice in directing traffic, your inner voice pretty much as we've learned it determines your destiny. So I am every time I speak to my sons, every time I speak to my grandsons, I'm very careful that, is this what I want them to say to themselves when they start maturing in life? That was a game changer for me big time.

Speaker 2
What questions should we be asking ourselves to better understand if the story we're telling ourselves is empowering or limiting us?

Speaker 1
Again, it's there's this level of awareness. And I have tried in my career to raise the curtain so that people understand that there's something going on that, you know, maybe was purely automatic. And maybe the voice you got, you never really intentionally acquired. But suddenly you have this critic inside yourself or the storyteller that we all have. And you have to stop and reflect is this I have rules of storytelling. They're not really rules that are guidelines. And the first thing is the rule has to be true. Is this aligned with reality? So the first awareness, am I making stuff up here that just is convenient for the moment to maybe make me feel better? Or is this aligned with really objective reality? That's the first kind of principle of really good storytelling. Another one is, is this storage that I'm telling myself, is it aligned with the best part of me? With who I really want to be in life, my values, my sense of purpose? Does this story take me where I want to go in life? Does it help me feel more optimistic and hopeful about my future? Or does it in fact give me a sense that, you know, I'm not that capable, world is tough. I probably can't make it. Why am I doing this? This is stupid. And so I really want people to have this kind of automatic sensor before you allow these stories to take form that you intentionally, purposefully, orchestrate them so that these stories Are aligned with the best part of you. And if they were made known publicly to all the people that you know, or put on a jumbo Tron, you would be proud of the way you have been coaching yourself, talking to yourself about what's The storm that you're in or about the future that you're crafting. And I'm very hopeful that the more we can bring an awareness to people's lives, I have changed so many people's thinking about so many things in sport and outside of it. And it's basically the question you ask, which is how do we make our stories really, really help us navigate better in life?

**Note:** Art of self-reinvention - consciously practicing identity change, melting down calcified consciousness, and courage to change identity as art form

> Embrace Reinvention to Unleash Originality

Summary:
Cultivating originality requires a commitment to self-reinvention and a deep understanding of internal drivers.

Individuals should follow intrinsic motivations rather than conforming to societal expectations, leading to the discovery of unique identities and connections with others who foster creativity. The process of reinvention often necessitates stepping back from established identities to explore new possibilities, embracing discomfort and uncertainty to allow for transformative growth.

By recognizing when one has become stagnant in their identity, individuals can actively engage in 'story hunting'—paying attention to original curiosities that reignite passion and authenticity.

The art of self-reinvention involves a continuous cycle of letting go of outdated narratives and crafting new ones that reflect genuine interests.

Solitude plays a crucial role in this process, enabling personal reflection and the development of a cohesive narrative, which subsequently informs collaborative efforts with others. A successful creative journey balances solitary exploration with collective experience, emphasizing that authenticity and meaningful storytelling emerge from self-awareness and introspection. Regularly stepping away from the demands of the external world is essential to nurture originality and cultivate the courage to forge a unique path.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so my curiosity to follow to have that opportunity had resulted in me meeting a character like Chris. Into the frames that the culture tells you, this is who you should be and how you should be. But rather they take the time to get tuned into what actually they feel pulled to. And then they figure out how to build their life externally around those internal knowings. And that usually results in a very original person. And so I've said, be a character who finds characters, because willing to become a character, follow your own internal knowings, will lead you to other unusual people. And that's where the meaning of life is.

Speaker 2
There's density in being willing to live like that. All of this is very much in the realm of getting going. The opposite side of this is, let's say you do all that successfully, whatever, you build the culture, you build the company, you do the thing, you meet the characters. And we were talking earlier about before recording, becoming a sort of slave to your greatest hits, like the Eagles or something. And there's a question here around reinvention or returning to some core essence or curiosity that got you to where you are in the first place. What could you say about that corollary problem of like, you do the first thing successfully. And then again, the world tries to build a circle around you and wants you to do the thing it knows you for versus the thing that you want to do at your core or something like that.

Speaker 1
I mean, I think that's one of the deepest tensions of any creative process. The example that you use is one my sister loves where the Eagles get up at their concert in Vegas now and people are still screaming, play Hotel California. That's something they wrote 40 years ago. And then an artist becomes famous for a certain body of work, certain type of painting style. And then that's all that is commercially wanted of them. And so it's a deep tension. I think that that's why I consider story hunting a practice. And it should never be a destination. Now, with culture, it does embed, you know, but even as a business, you have to be constantly willing to look at it all and reinvent yourself. And the only way to do that is to be willing to be in states of reinvention yourself. I always think about personal identity. I think about practice. I think about how that could become an external expression, a group identity. In the coaching space, one thing we would say often is like being aware of your own stories. And I think that changing identity is an art form. And I think that you have to be self-aware enough to realize that there are times when change comes upon you as a result of a catalytic event. And there are times when you should, if with enough self-awareness sense that you are becoming calcified in your consciousness, in a certain identity. And the art of reinvention is exactly that. It's an art form. And it usually begins with some form of letting go of how we thought it had to be. It's Tiger Woods being a world champion, being the best in the world and going to reinvent his swing. It's a very, very courageous moment. And you can only know if you've reached that calcified place. And so then you have to go and melt down. And that's usually stepping out of life and allowing your ideas about who you think you are, who you would think you are meant to be, who other people have made you to be. You have to let that melt. And that means you have to step into like, I don't know what's going to be next and really dwell in that not knowing. And then the next phase would be to start to attune yourself to the meaning again. How do you hunt the story? You have to start paying attention to those original curiosities, things that pull you forward, characters who light you up and start to ask yourself, what is it about these things That grab my attention? And then you go into another phase of starting to build around that. If you are someone who can constantly put attention on transforming yourself, almost always new meaning will constellate around that. A new story of yourself will constellate around that. And sometimes in coaching, we will even say to someone, you can feel when someone's stuck in something and it's just become an old shtick. We'll actually say, you know, that's actually just starting to feel like a story. It doesn't feel like it has aliveness in it. So self-reinvention, the courage to self-reinvent, the courage to melt down and change your own identity, and to be in the practice then of hunting new stories and new ways of being. That is the art form of staying original, keeping your consciousness malleable and staying in tune with what actually brings you to life as opposed to being just rolling out your greatest Hits album for the next 30 years. I guess what I'm saying is this is a practice and you have to consciously practice it, consciously be stepping back and saying, does my story about who we are, who I am, even fit anymore?

Speaker 2
I'm thinking about the story lab, which is such a good idea. And the other people that I've turned to to teach me about components or elements of a good story. And the one that always comes to my mind is Graydon Carters, who used to run Vanity Fair and was certainly no stranger to a great story, which was basically narrative, conflict, and he Called it proprietary data, something I know that other people don't know. A great story has those three components to it, narrative conflict and some unique information that others could learn from. I'm curious your reaction to those three. I mentioned them just as an example of what I'm after with this question, which is the components to you of a great story.

Speaker 1
Yeah, I think those are very strong. Just from a technical point of view, I think you want to start with something very unusual. So I think that the opening line of any piece of storytelling is incredibly important, because it immediately helps people know how to feel about where this is going. Then I think you should develop your characters. And you should help people understand how your characters were thinking about issues. Then you should help people understand what the challenge was and what the conflict was and how they got through it. Then you should have some callbacks to things you learned along the way. And then you should land it in a very universal place as much as possible. Those are more like technical beats. And then within that, I would say that the use of language is incredibly important. With a single word, you can change the real feeling of something. If I said, the buffalo was close by by the time I saw it, versus when I saw the buffalo, it was adjacent.

> Building Multifaceted Identities to Achieve Goals

Summary:
Our perceived identity can greatly influence our actions and limit our potential when we label ourselves negatively.

By embracing multifaceted identities, we can adapt to various challenges and changes in life without feeling a loss of self-worth. It's essential to have identity layers that can serve as a safe landing for us in difficult times, providing resilience and pragmatism.

These layers can be chosen strategically based on the situation we are facing, enabling us to leverage our identity to accomplish our goals effectively.

However, our self-assessments must be grounded in reality and open to feedback to ensure alignment with how others perceive us.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Absolutely. It's so well said and it's very much a narrative we tell ourselves. And to your point, it can be extremely limiting because when we in some ways like tight cast ourselves, let's say as being non -technical or as being not as social as other people or not As strong or physically, whatever it is, that can really hinder our progress because there is research on identity priming, which says that we do act in ways that are consistent with Our perceived identity or the identity we aspire to have. Right. So when we see ourselves as a voter, we're more likely to vote. When we see ourselves being eco -friendly, we're more likely to recycle. By the same token, if we see ourselves through these more negative labels, then we might also act in ways that align with that and needlessly hold ourselves back when it comes to making Progress. About kind of accountability. Like when you self -identify as say non -technical, you're off the hook of it, right? You don't have to try as much because you've just already decided that you fall into that bucket. And so you don't actually reach whatever growth potential you have in that area, because you kind of just written yourself off. That part really resonates with me. And I think that's an excellent point.

Speaker 2
Sort of hit on a little bit the risks of wrapping yourself with an instrument or I think that transfers to something like a profession. And if we're no longer able to do it, then it can cause sort of an identity crisis. Can that also be a plus? So I guess the sort of meta question is how can we use our identity to help us accomplish our goals?

Speaker 1
There are absolutely pros and pluses to anchoring ourselves to what we do. It also gives us a clear sense of a future that we can imagine, right? The future might look kind of blurry and amorphous and when you identify as having a certain profession, you can at least project what you think the next five years can look like. And so there's definitely benefits to anchoring yourself and identity. And that's why I don't want us to do away with that concept altogether. What I'm proposing is having multifaceted identities. So you have multiple layers of abstraction when it comes to where you derive meaning and how you define yourself. And so at one level, you can absolutely say, okay, I'm a lawyer, I'm a doctor, a stay -at -home mom, I'm a tech worker. And then you can have deeper layers of identity that can be your safe landing, you know, almost like a parachute, when life throws you a change that you can fall back on so that when that Thing maybe is threatened for whatever reason, I mean, maybe you get into an accident and you don't have the same abilities that you had before. You get a chronic illness that prevents you from doing those things. You don't feel that your entire self -worth has been stripped away in the process. That is destabilizing in a way that I think is counterproductive. And I'm always trying to be a pragmatist about things and figure out, okay, what are the ways that we can try to show as much resilience as possible in these moments. And so I do think that you can try to build identity layers, if you will. And depending on the moment in your life that you're engaging in and the challenges that you're being thrown, you can almost opportunistically choose that level of abstraction, right? You can choose the layer at which you want to self -identify. It's possible that in the moment at your job, it's not that helpful to think of yourself as, oh, I'm the type of person who loves connecting with people because you have a really annoying Work assignment that's due in five hours. And that's not going to be sufficiently motivating, right? And so that's where you might call upon the stricter label, which is just what you do.

Speaker 2
I like that because it's sort of like you can turn identity into whatever you want to help you accomplish your goals.

Speaker 1
As long as it's not delusional. So I really don't, I'm not okay with people telling themselves stories that are simply advantageous or promote psychological well -being, right? They have to be rooted in reality. They have to be to some degree vetted by the people in your life. If you identify as like an extremely compassionate person, but then the people around you don't feel that way about you, it's worth potentially revisiting and updating. So I really do feel like we need to allow in feedback in those spaces and just make sure that whatever our self -assessment is, is at least in part rooted in evidence that we're collecting About ourselves along the way.

**Note:** Shows conscious identity creation in organizations - creating shared language and story that becomes embedded culture, with individuals relating to group narrative

> Cultivating Culture Through Storytelling

Summary:
Creating a strong organizational culture begins with consciously developing an identity and shared language that embeds itself over time.

This identity evolves as individuals relate to a deepening narrative, shaping their connection to both the group and personal identity. By frequently communicating the story of the organization's origins and values, such as a commitment to excellence and care for the environment, members begin to internalize these principles, facilitating a culture of belonging.

New members can quickly assimilate into this culture, often expressing its narrative they've only recently learned.

The success of a culture relies on living out its principles daily, going beyond mere storytelling to actual practices.

The practice of storytelling itself is a skill that can be developed, underscoring the importance of intentional, consistent communication in fostering a vibrant culture and achieving collective goals.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
At first, it's actually consciously creating an identity for yourself and the business. But then what it should become is an identity that people don't even have to think about it as an identity, it's just embedded. And so as people join and the culture deepens and the story of who we are deepens, it's like it becomes its own self-creating field. And individuals working within it relate to themselves as a part of that story, that culture, that way of being. So that's why I think early on, if you can create a shared language, consciously work on telling your story, it will result in the beginnings of a very, very deep culture. And actually a self-identity and a group identity, which is really what culture is.

Speaker 2
Maybe just to put a finer point on it with an example, how would you describe the Londo's culture and maybe the story that was the seed of what's become that culture?

Speaker 1
I think at this point, it's almost become a law. And there were elements to it. It begins with this incredible love. The business was founded with its three mud huts out of a sense that if we don't start something here, we're going to lose this wild piece of land. And then the founders almost lived the story into life. And at first it was a passion to restore the land. And then later it became a passion for excellence in service. Now over the years, that story has been told enough. It has become central to everything that happens there. And there's such a sense of who we are that has emerged out of that story, care of the land, care of the people there, making sure that we give people transformative healing experiences In nature. And it's just been spoken so much and then lived so much that it has now become a way of being. So the challenge of it, I guess, is that it becomes quite like, it's almost ethereal, but it is a culture of belonging. It is a culture that you join, and it's a group identity and an individual identity at the same time. It's a way we do things around here. People arrive now at Londo's, the culture, if they are not of the culture, and it's amazing how quickly people are assimilated into that culture, they expunge themselves almost. It's like an energetic beat that is off. My favorite thing is three or four weeks after a new person arrives at Londolozi. And I think of us actually consciously working on our narrative, being really good at storytelling, making sure we understand how to express that we've taken the time to express all The dimensions of what we're trying to do. And then you find yourself walking along one of the paths and you hear a new arrival coming the other way. And they are telling the story in literally something that you heard in a workshop two months ago that you've spoken about and put into our information about who we are. And then you start to see how it's translating and then living into it. I think also the story has to be backed up by daily ways of being and actions. And so that's why the story is the beginning of framing who we are and our identity, but then the real culture of it is brought to life by living it. How do you make that work?

Speaker 2
I love the notion of doing such a good job that the people in the culture, the story becomes portable and they start telling it. Is there any advice you'd give on how to make a story portable in that way and easy for someone to pick up and run with themselves?

Speaker 1
Yes. I would say that for us, we have our history, why and how we came to be where we are. Then we have who we are right now as a big part of the story. We're a futuristic African village. We take people on world-class encounters in nature. We're a culture business. We care about people. And we deeply believe that if we take a lot of time to make sure that this is an incredible place for people to live and work with dignity in South Africa, That results in amazing outputs. On the other side, we're obsessed with excellence. So we have these pillars and then we speak to them vigorously. And so when you're inducted at Londozi, all of these things will get told to you time and time again. One of our things is that we're a place and a space for individuals to become the best versions of themselves. It's focused towards being a growth environment, but we can then measure ourselves at every juncture. Are we living up to that? Are these individuals who've joined our team, are they becoming the best version of themselves? What do they need to grow? Because that's central to how we relate to ourselves. So on some deep level, once you've taken the time to work on it and frame it, you live it until it becomes a group identity. And then actually individual identities within that it should offend you to operate outside of your own cultural values on some level. When Duncan McLarty, the general manager sees something that is subpar, it offends him personally, because it's against who we are on some fundamental level. So again, I would say that what people don't realize is when they see good storytellers, they think, oh, he's just a good storyteller, and I'm not. And what I'm saying is that actually becoming a good storyteller is a mindset, and it's an approach. You can practice it. And becoming a good storyteller is taking the time to work on the craft of it and actually realize that if you get this stuff right, it can have an incredible impact into your life and into Your business and into your culture. But it does deserve being taken up as a powerful practice.

**Note:** Perfect encapsulation - identity is shaped by experiences, but we can anchor to 'why' rather than 'what' for resilience, recognizing identity as constructed narrative

> Expanding Identity: Embracing Change and Self-Reflection

Summary:
Identity can be shaped by experiences that limit opportunities, leading to disorientation and self-reflection.

Anchoring identity to 'why' rather than 'what' can foster resilience and adaptability. By identifying the core passions and traits driving one's pursuits, individuals can find meaning in various endeavors, enhancing emotional connection and personal growth.

Embracing expansive and flexible identities allows for continuous self-exploration and adaptation in the face of life's changes, revealing hidden resilience and untapped skills.

Ultimately, identity is a narrative that can either limit growth or empower personal development.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
We can have what I would call change induced identity foreclosure where you go through an experience and it just naturally cuts off opportunities for you. And then you have to figure out what comes next. When I was 15, I certainly fell prey to this kind of foreclosure because I had built my entire self around the violin without exploring who else I could be. And so then when I lost it, I felt extremely disoriented. There is a potentially more robust and sustainable way to define yourself. So I don't think we're going to get rid of the human desire to identify with things in general, to have strong identities. They're a huge source of inspiration and focus and they can give us feelings of belonging and community. They can give us drive and motivation, right? If I define myself as a violinist, every morning when I wake up, I know what I want to do and I'm willing to commit to hours and hours of practice. The challenge becomes though when you anchor yourself to something that is precarious in some way and that's what I found with the violin. What I strive to do, because it's very much a works in progress, but I hope this resonates for your listeners, is to attach my sense identity and worth not to what I do, but to why I do it. So this has been an exercise in trying to understand, okay, Maya, you fell in love with the violin and you enjoyed it for so many reasons. What was it about the violin that was so intoxicating for you? What were the features that made you light up? And when I stripped away the superficial features of the violin and kind of looked under the surface, I realized that there were many traits and features of playing music that really Resonated with me, but in ways that transcended the violin. So I loved emotionally connecting with people through music. I loved the idea of honing a craft and slowly chipping away and getting better at something and witnessing that kind of progress. I loved having this kind of single -minded determination and these goals that I was chasing. It was possible for me to find those same features in other pursuits, right? If I just looked hard enough. So I could still find my love of human connection in other places. And in fact, I have, right? And being a cognitive scientist and now in having my podcast, A Slight Change of Plans, it's all about forging deep emotional connections with people, right? And I can witness progress in my role as an interviewer or in my role as a scientist. And so I would urge people to ask themselves, what is it that sits at the root of my passions in life? And can I find my meaning and worth and place my identity in that such that when life throws me a big change of plans, a massive curve ball, I can mourn that loss, sure, but I don't feel completely Disoriented because there's still so much of me that persists and that I can find expressions of in other mediums.

Speaker 2
As you're saying that, it's like we can identify our identity with a skill, we can do it with a habit, we can do it with something larger like Democrat or Republican, we can do it with something Still larger like American or Canadian or European, and can do it from what to why, which sort of makes me wonder what is identity.

Speaker 1
It's a deeply complicated philosophical question that people have been pondering for basically as long as we've been around. The way that I approach it actually is about expanding people's sense of self. Because I think what happens, especially as we get older, that we lock into an understanding of who we are, who we think we are. And it's often not totally accurate, and it's certainly not comprehensive. I mean, our sense of identity is formulated based on the quite random events that have occurred in our lives and the various ways in which we've been pressure tested or pushed or challenged. And we didn't choose that path, right, to reveal to us the maximum number of data points about ourselves. We were just living life and going through it and seeing what happened. And so I think because we have a first -person perspective on our minds, we sometimes believe that we have a very good understanding of who we are. And then what happens in the face of a change is it reveals to us all that remained hidden from you, right? All that existed that maybe didn't have a reason to be expressed before then, or the various ways in which we're more resilient, or the greater number of skills that we have, or the coping Mechanisms that we have at our disposal. And when I think about identity, I think we benefit from having more expansive identities and identities that feel more malleable, that don't feel fixed in ways that are problematic. As we navigate the many years of life that we have, we're willing to revisit and we're willing to re -examine and we're willing to see in a more flexible way.

Speaker 2
It feels like it can be limiting and empowering. It's almost like a thermos. It reinforces whatever you put into it. It doesn't have a judgment of a good or bad. But if we identify as a non -technical person or something, it's almost as if we absolve ourselves of the responsibility to learn and grow. So in a sense, as you were saying that, it's almost like our identity is the story we tell ourselves.

> Exploring Identity Through Change

Summary:
People who undergo significant change often experience a shift in their internal identity, leading them to question who they can become in the new circumstances.

The podcast host initially focusing on change realized that the core theme was fundamentally about identity. Cognitive psychology introduces the concept of identity foreclosure, where individuals prematurely settle on an identity without exploring all possibilities.

During adolescence, societal influences play a significant role in shaping our identities, but part of growing up involves examining, trying on, and choosing which identity labels or roles feel authentic and which ones we want to reject or embrace.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And especially as I moved my interest towards this topic of change, right? In my podcast, A Slight Change of Plans, I interview people who have gone through just harrowing tales of change at times. And what you realize along the way is that they're not just telling you this external story of change. They're talking to you about something internal that shifted. And oftentimes it's the loss of an identity unexpectedly. And they're trying to figure out who they can be in the face of this change. And so fairly quickly after starting my show, I realized, wow, you know, I don't even know if this is a show about change. Is really a show fundamentally about identity. There's a concept in cognitive psychology called identity foreclosure, and it refers to the idea that we can prematurely commit to an identity before having fully explored all other Ways that we can be or the things that we want to be in this life. And this often happens in adolescence. So we see things modeled for us through our environment, through parents, through coaches, through teachers, through our community, right? We're often just spoon -fed certain identity labels or roles that we feel we should play. And part of the process of growing up is examining those labels for ourselves and trying them on for fit and figuring out which ones feel good and which ones don't and which ones we want To reject and which ones we want to embrace.

> A Story Transforms; Reporting Does Not

Summary:
A good story differs from a bad story in its ability to convey change and transformation over time.

Rather than merely recounting events chronologically, an effective story showcases a realization or personal growth. This transformative quality engages the audience, as they are more interested in narratives that offer entertainment or insight rather than mere reports of daily life.

To craft a memorable story, one must understand that listeners seek reasons to engage with the narrative and must approach storytelling with the intention of holding their attention.

The distinction between a well-told story and a lackluster one lies in the storyteller's commitment to entertain and provide value, encouraging a genuine connection with the audience.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
What's the difference between a good story and a bad story? I think we can start by thinking about what is a story and what isn't a story because most people don't tell stories. Most people think of a story as some stuff happened over the course of time and now I'm going to tell you about that, usually chronologically and that will amount to a story. And that really is just reporting on your life and no one actually wants you to report on your life. You know, other than maybe your mother and your spouse might be required to listen. It's just a simple accounting of your day or your week or your month and that's not interesting and it's not a story. So a story is about change over time. Usually it's sort of a realization. Like I used to think one thing and now I think another thing. That's most stories. Sometimes they're transformational, meaning I once was one kind of person, then some stuff happened and now I'm actually an authentically different kind of person. But if you're just doing that, you're better than most people. That sort of is the difference between a bad story and a good story, is what is a story and what is not a story. Once we get to the difference between sort of a well-told story or well-crafted story, and one that is not as well crafted, we get into things like the acknowledgement that no one wants To hear anything you ever have to say unless you give them a reason to listen. And there are people who tell stories that don't have that fundamental belief as part of their bone marrow. And the more you believe that, the more you believe that I must entertain while speaking, delivering content, showing data, delivering a keynote, the more you believe that no one wants To hear anything I have to say, unless I'm relentlessly giving them a reason to listen. That's really the difference between someone who is going to be appreciated and remembered and impactful and someone who will sort of get lost in the crowd.

Speaker 2
Of the difference boils down to thinking about the story you're going to tell beforehand? And then there's like this game where you're pretending to sort of like ad lib it on the spot and the listener is like pretending that you're ad libbing it on the spot because they want That too.

> Vulnerability Enhances Connection in Storytelling

Summary:
Embracing vulnerability in storytelling fosters audience engagement.

Rather than eliminating mistakes or foolish actions, highlighting them can create relatable and compelling narratives. Effective stories are not merely sequences of unrelated events ('and stories') but rather interconnected moments that build tension and connection ('but...

therefore' stories). Each scene should meaningfully contribute to the overall narrative, making it impossible to remove elements without losing coherence.

Stories should evoke emotions and maintain momentum, drawing the audience into the journey through the strategic use of conjunctions. The word 'but' stands out as a powerful tool, introducing conflict and complexity to capture listeners' interest.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
If I did something stupid over the course of the story, I'm not going to remove the stupid thing I did in an effort to make myself look better. In fact, I will enhance the stupid thing I did because I know that audiences really want, you know, that vulnerability is what they crave. So whenever I do something stupid, I am thrilled because it often means I'm going to have a story to tell.

Speaker 2
A lot of people tell and stories. This happened and then this and then this and then this. Right. And it's not super engaging. And I remember listening to a clip, the South Park guys, they used the terms but and therefore and then I remember reading this in your books to talk to me about this and like how we take

Speaker 1
An end story and make it a but therefore story. It was devastating from when I saw that clip too, because I thought I had stumbled upon something that was mine like, hey, look what I found. And then someone said, that's great. Did you know the South Park guys believe that too? And I was like, oh, really? I was going to be like Matthew Dicks only. But they're right. And I'm right too. And Anne's story is essentially a story that is a series of events, one after the other, that are not connected in any meaningful way. First graders tell those stories all the time. I got up and then I got my cereal and then I went to school, right? But adults still tell those stories too. Actually, most decks that I'm working on with marketing and salespeople are and stories. You know it's an and story because if you can just throw a slide into a deck, you don't have a story. Because I couldn't just throw a scene into the spoon of power and still have that story work, right? But people feel they can do that. I'm like, well, that's fine, but you're not telling a story. Now you're just, you're just a slide monkey. You're just throwing in slides. So an Anne story is the kind of story that if we take something out, the story still plays. Nothing really changes in the story. We still can get to the end, which means it's probably not a story. You're probably just reporting on your day. But our therefore stories rely on connection. Scenes are connected to other scenes, connected to other scenes. So I'm doing this, but that happened. Therefore this happened, but then that happened. And when we connect it in that way, we can't actually remove anything from the story because the story will fall apart. I also think it creates motion in a story, sort of an angular, exciting nature to the story. The spoon of power appears, but it's not the spoon of power. It's not just a spoon, it's the spoon of power. Therefore, I must have it. So, which is because, which is therefore, so I chase Jamie, but I don't get it. But that's okay because he's my student and I'm still gonna have time to teach him. So I'm in math, right? But he's put the spoon right here. So we're in this standoff. Then we're, I'm doing reading, but the spoon is still here. But that's okay because eventually I'm gonna teach writing. I walk up the but the spoon isn't here. The bell rings, therefore Jamie gets out of the seat, runs over to his coat, but also goes to the library and pulls out the spoon. So if you're butting and thereforeing all the way through, you know that every scene is required. You know you don't have any fluff along the way, there's no extra scene sort of hanging out. And people are gonna be so invested in the story. I always tell people the but is the most powerful word in all of storytelling.

> Seek Stories in the Uncharted

Summary:
Finding meaning and purpose involves actively seeking out stories and experiences that challenge and expand one's perspective.

This process, termed 'story hunting,' requires a mindset of awareness and openness, pushing individuals to explore uncharted territories, both literally and metaphorically. Embracing curiosity invites unusual encounters and deep connections with others.

Practicing storytelling hinges on attentiveness; by reflecting on life's experiences, individuals can uncover meaningful narratives.

Great storytellers create contexts, facilitating understanding and inviting collective participation.

Navigating fear serves as a catalyst for connection and growth, where the right approach transforms anxiety into opportunity, fostering resilience and camaraderie among groups. Ultimately, embracing life's unpredictability and sharing experiences enriches personal and communal meaning, evolving into a shared narrative that bonds individuals together.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
It's a big question, but finding meaning or purpose in the first place?

Speaker 1
It is a big question. And that's why I called it story hunting, because it is a turning of your attention. I think our first podcast was about tracking. I'm always interested in this idea of turning your attention onto something because that's essentially what tracking is. And that's why it became story hunting, because you have to develop a way of seeing and almost drop into a set of principles. So there's a few things that I said, the one was become someone's stories happen around. And I think of this all as a practice. So that is an awareness and an openness to life. It's a willingness to say yes, it's a willingness to try things. Often it's going into uncharted terrain. I had one friend who whenever we'd go on a hike, almost always if there was a path that said, this path is closed, he wanted to go down. So the first part is be someone stories happens around. And that to me is a mindset. I would say, be a character who finds characters. And what I mean by that is the more you become aware of what lights you up internally, the more you're willing to follow your curiosity, often that will pull you into unusual encounters. So many of the most amazing and outrageous people I've met, it's because I was willing to follow something. I think about recently that trail we went on together, Matt, who is this wild man trail guide. It's like a willingness to go and try things and you start having encounters with people who are very in tune with what brings them to life in the world.

Speaker 2
Can you explain him? That's a really good example of just a person that has this vibe about them. Maybe say a little bit more about Matt.

Speaker 1
Yeah. In the realms of be a character who finds character, he loves the wilderness. He loves wild places. His company is called Wild Child Africa. His central mission is to find the most remote wild places and then take people there. And so he's just following a love for what he likes to do. And then he's figuring out how to expose that to other people. And then even within those wild places, he finds ways to go on little adventures and have little experiences within them. I mean, this is a guy who's made friends with an eel in a pool in the Pondor lab. Something about that is like, he's full of that be someone stories happen around, be a character who finds characters. He's just living in that way. And then I would also say that storytelling is attention. We are so distracted most of the time. If you are a storyteller, you have to be paying attention and seeing what is actually there. One thing that I'll do with people early on, if they want to improve their storytelling, is I'll just say to them, tell me about your life. And there is something about taking time, even thinking about all of the threads that brought you to where you are, all of the plot twists, all of the unexpected encounters. And literally when you take the time to put attention on how you got to where you are, you start to find that there is a narrative component to life. There is meaning to the way that it all tied together. And literally when you take the time to put your attention on it, these threads start to come together. And so to get back to your original question, to become someone who can hold the meaning for the village, for the company, for the team, it requires you to start to turn your attention To what is meaningful to you, to be willing to be open enough to try things, to follow your own curiosity and meet interesting people. And it's an opening of your life and your attention. And the other thing then is I say that great storytellers are always context creators. And I think Steve Jobs was so good at this. If you watch old clips, he's so good at saying, here's how I'm thinking about this. Here's the challenges that come up when I think about this. Here's how I think we should be facing that. And here's the things I don't know about. He stays away from being just singularly positional and he just creates a context. And then into that, people start feeding their ideas. So the journey to actually finding more meaning is to start to open yourself to the awareness of your stories, what's going on here, looking with the right type of eyes. That's sort of how I start to think about how it constellates.

Speaker 2
What about fear? Thinking back on our most recent time together with Matt, if you just asked me to viscerally recall something from the trip, the two moments that come to mind were the two by far physical Scariest moments. And both of which are, like you said with the lion, in the moment, you're just kind of scared. But then after the fact, it becomes this thing imbued with meaning. What do you make of that, that it seems like so much of the meaning and purpose is found, like there's some fear in or around the path?

Speaker 1
Yeah, absolutely. And I think there's sort of a sweet spot there. There's the type of fear that's overwhelming and actually shuts you down. But then there's the type of fear that as you face it together, and you stand in the face of it, it actually brings you together. I mean, I think about we had to swim across that one wild piece of ocean. But again, the story there, the way that Matt framed it as a storyteller, is part of creating a shared sense of how we're going to do this together. This is a very rough piece of ocean. I can tell you that if you get sucked off to the side there, swim in that direction, and it'll pop you back in. We have a couple of guys here who are going to be the grabbers when people swim back. I am going to call the gap between the sets. And so he's giving us a sense of we do this with the right type of people. If you do this and we approach it with the right mentality, we can do it safely. We do have to take care of each other and be aware. But the briefing he gave us on that was a great example of helping us understand that this is an edge, but if we approach it properly, and if you follow my guidance and we work together, We can get through that. He created a frame for us to think about it. He created a context that we got to watch ourselves here, but he also created the guidelines for how to do it well together. And I think that was the perfect example of being up against an edge, but then framing it correctly so that people know how to handle it. He helped us understand how to feel about it. And I think that is so important as a leader. You're queuing people into how to feel about the situation.

> An Anecdote Delights, a Story Resonates

Summary:
Anecdotes serve as brief, entertaining moments that provoke laughter but fade quickly from memory, akin to cotton candy.

In contrast, stories create lasting impressions, engaging emotions and provoking deep reflection. While anecdotes share a surface-level experience, stories forge connections that resonate long after they are told, evoking personal feelings and shared human experiences.

The intent behind a story is to cultivate a meaningful emotional connection rather than simply recount an event.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
So an anecdote doesn't have to have change over time. It's essentially one of those, hey, this funny thing happened to me, isn't this crazy? But it tends not to linger. You know, a story ideally is the kind of thing that when I tell it to you, you're thinking about it for days, weeks, months, or maybe for the rest of your life. Whereas an anecdote is you sit down and you have beers with your buddies and something crazy happened on the golf course, you know, something happened in the airport and you tell them It and they all laugh. But it's not the kind of thing they want to go and repeat to someone. They're not going to remember it. I often think of anecdotes as cotton candy. It's like delicious in the moment and lovely but you don't really remember your cotton candies but you remember the best meals of your life. Stories are the best meals of your life. The ones you reflect back and go I remember the restaurant, I remember who I was with, I remember what I ordered. That's the story.

Speaker 2
Because you're connecting to an emotion?

Speaker 1
Ideally touching their hearts and their minds. If I tell you an anecdote about my son, we're gonna laugh, we're gonna understand his humanity even a little bit, you might even reflect on my humanity, but you're not going to be sort Of thinking about it later on because I'm not looking to land something in your heart and mind. I'm not looking to connect to your life experiences. When I tell a story, I'm not hoping that you are thinking that once happened to me. What I'm hoping is you're thinking I once felt that way.

Speaker 2
I once thought that way or maybe someday I could feel or think that way. That's the goal. That's sort of that under story that we're always looking to tell. So before we get into more of a crafting a story, maybe it would help to have an example of a story.

> A Simple Kiss Can Solve Complex Problems

Summary:
Sharing personal stories creates strong emotional connections and memorable insights.

Using simple, relatable solutions, like kissing a spouse every morning, can convey deeper lessons, making complex business concepts accessible. Vulnerability in storytelling resonates with audiences, ensuring that the key message—a singular solution can address significant challenges—remains memorable and impactful.

This approach contrasts with the tendency to stick to business narratives that are often forgettable.

By incorporating personal elements into professional discussions, stories become metaphors that encourage introspection and change, leaving lasting impressions that reverberate through people's lives.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
We'll start telling you who your friends are that you have in common. All of those features were designed so Facebook figures out that's the one bottleneck we have. That's what he wants to tell the, tell the audience. But he doesn't want to just use that story, he wants other things, right? So when I'm talking to him I say, well what are other examples of sort of singular solutions that you can think of? He gives me a business solution, which is just content matching. You already have your business example, the Facebook one, and it works really well. I think it's great. Like right away I went, uh-huh, yeah, okay, great. I said, what about in your personal life? Do you have a personal life, you know, simple solution that really changed things for you? He says, well, there was a point years ago when I was struggling with my marriage, you know, my wife and I were just not getting along. And we had gone to couples therapy and it wasn't seeming to work and one day he sat down with his buddy and his buddy said, are you kissing your wife every morning? And he said, no. And his buddy said, kiss your wife every morning, you know, and he said, what's that going to do? He said, just do it. And it changed everything for him. Somehow there was a lack of physical closeness and intimacy that was missing in the relationship. And a kiss in the morning started to change everything for them. I said, that's the story you should use. And he goes, I'm not using that story. He said, that's not like what the purpose of this business is. And I said, no one's going to remember your other business story. In fact, a lot of people aren't even going to remember the Facebook story. But if you want to land the idea that sometimes a singular solution can solve a big problem, you tell the story about kissing your wife in the morning and they'll never forget it. And they'll start kissing their wives in the morning and they will start telling other people to do so as well. You will have an echo through their lives. Now that's a metaphor, right? That's a metaphor for his Facebook example, which is what I said to him was the Facebook example matching theme, meaning, or message essentially is what's the theme, meaning, or message Of the Facebook story? A singular solution can sometimes solve a really complex problem. So let's find that in our personal life. Now I'm always fighting with business on this because they never want to bring their personal life into the business world, which is why they're round, white, and flavorless, why they're All forgettable, why everything they say is ultimately forgotten. Because we don't remember business stories, we don't remember most of them. And there's so many of them. But a guy who gets on stage and is vulnerable enough to say a few years ago I was having a problem with my wife and she was having a problem with me and we were not getting along and things were Looking bad. And then I told my buddy and I end up kissing her and somehow today we're the happiest couple in the... That's unforgettable. Now, I think he's gonna do it. But part of me thinks he just told me he's gonna do it and he's not gonna do it. That happens all the damn time. I don't understand why people don't see it because I know you see it. Like you made a sound, right? I listened to audiences. When I said, do you kiss your wife every morning, you made a sound. You went, mmm. Which said to me, that's all I need to know. The story is perfect, right? When you hear that sound from an audience, you know, you have found the perfect story for this example. And if he was you, and I was telling him the story, he would make that sound. He'd go, hmm. But for some reason, because he has to tell it now, he can't do it because I can't tell a personal story. I'm there to teach them about solving business problems and bottlenecks, right? And I'm like, you are? But we don't teach lessons, like, always by sticking to the content, right? We have to expand beyond it to get people to understand it. Particularly when things get complex, when your business is different than mine, you know, you have a platform and I have a broom company. How are we going to talk to someone who's working for Slack and someone who's working for a broom company, right? If both of those people are in front of us and we're trying to improve their businesses, how are we going to do that? We're going to use metaphors. We're going to find ways to send lessons and messages to people in ways that resonate in their lives. Now, the beauty of that story too, and all the stories I teach, like the story of Boris, you know, the one you mentioned about the baseball game. When we do that, when we're daring enough courageous enough to do it, we create these markers in people's lives as well. The next time one spouse kisses another spouse in the morning, they're thinking about him and they're thinking about simple solutions to solve bottlenecks. It's going to continue to reverberate.

> Prefrontal cortex does the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do like looking for traffic before you jaywalk or looking for the light on top of a yellow car when hailing a cab. This mediates executive action considering info choosing bits of info to focus on then making a decision. Self control is finite resource pfc is the most vulnerable to overload from too much cognitive load. This is worked when learning but becomes easy once we learn something then it becomes innate like learning to pee requires a ton of attention but very little now. Social complexity expands the pfc and allows us to do the hard thing like not farting in public or restraining hitting on someone requires a lot of the pfc. this is how we control our inhibition. There are different areas of the brain that control thinking and decision making so we can know the right thing to do but when it comes time to do it our brain can make a separate decision overridden by emotions vmplc and dmplc battle for emotion and cognition and when the emotion part is damaged we struggle to internalize things and can’t learn make decisions vs when we lose logic we become illogical. Emotion is vital to non emotional judgement. The point of cbt is reprising past thought patterns and switching their meaning. Transcending the old thought to create a new positive though this belief is as the core of therapy. Therapy is replacing not forgetting thought and having agency to do that. We do the hard thing that isn’t always easy through dopamine

> Layers of the brain one is the most ancient level that does automates activity if your body is cold the body works harder to warm up. Layer 2 directs layer one through emotions we feel bad so we tell layer 1 to send signal to stress eat. Layer 3 neocortex this is we control feelings send them to layer 2 then layer 1. These are not purely hierarchical and can have complex interactions. Automaticity emotion and cognition the 3 layers. Autonomic nervous system mid brain and brain stem that communicate between body and involuntary aspects like heating and cooling. Like a reptile telling them to raise or lower body temperature without thought. Autonomic has sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system the first controls fear and fight and flight the other works on regulation of calm vegetative states like digestion. If you’re being chased don’t worry about digestion. Ramp up vs calm down. Cortex is area of cognition and logic but the limbic system talks with the cortex. The cortex is how layer 2 talks to layer 3. Amigdala is where aggression fear and anxiety originate. The default state is to trust amygdala teaches us vigilance and distrust. It teaches us to learn fears like Pavlovian conditioning of fear but we cannot forget fear we must follow the same pathways to conquer our fears. Amygdala is about the uncertainty and yern for potential pleasure anxiety and fear in pursuit of pleasure. Unpredictable pain is what activates the amygdala.

**Note:** Explains how neurons build knowledge through reinforced connections and reaching critical thresholds for learning

> Neurons and knowledge doesn’t lie is having more neurons but stronger pathways between neurons. The neurons rely to non linear processes. You need to reach a threshold of glutamate to unlock learning. This is why it takes time to learn things and it can go in one ear and out the other learning requires reaching a critical threshold once this is done the material is incorporate in neurons and effectively this this the learning process. This is our information gets in the brain in the neurons, but then LTP help to become stored, long-term and remembered. This is how you remember facts not as much processes and then the info is passed when the information is destroyed and rebuilt. Stress blocks some of these hormones which impairs learning. Experience alters neurons to increase learning through more repetition that calcifies knowledge more. We have recently learned we can grow new neurons even in old age and we can do this through exercise enrichment learning among others and inhibited by various stressors. Adult neurogenesis is a new idea that was rejected by dogma for 50 years before it became accepted as real. We can grow the size of our brains. Our brains are always evolving and we can always keep learning positively or negatively. End dogma adult brains are set in stone.

> Mental life is conducted at a stroll and only rarely are we engaging system 2 in an effortfull jog or run. When we become super focused we also become blind to many things. You can be super focused on reading but not see the gorilla on the screen. Mental effort is also finite and runs out when you are using it more the less you see around you. You only have x amount of attention so even if you’re 100% focused you can’t have materially more attention than your max capable attention. The more skilled or talented you are at something the less attention you need to devote to it to perform at a similar level to someone with less of the two. System one can deal with simple integrations but system 2 deals with integrating complex topics Intelligence is the control of attention and efficiency in performing tasks. Time pressure adds to fast thinking and causes more effortful thinking We solve by easy steps and work by the law of least effort

> Cognitive [neuroscience](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neurosciences) is undergoing a kind of Gestalt switch, from an understanding of the brain as a vessel that ‘drinks in’ the world, to an organ that repeatedly regurgitates the world through predictions derived from the past. This view of experience—as deeply contrived through past learning—is remarkably similar to Buddhist ideas of the conditioned nature of experience, as the above quote illustrates. Moreover, the gradual breaking down of concepts in Buddhist meditation maps on strikingly well to the notion of the predictive model-building brain.

> Aristotle saw the heart and the center of body and the brain was a cool organ the balanced the hot heart golden mean. The mind is the principle and anima the thing that makes things alive. Focused on motion and change. Motion and change are big concepts for him. Mind body dualism was Descartes idea and this has lead to some confusing explanations among religion where people have tried to fit their views into this paradigm with less than compelling explanations. Behaviorism and untangling the brain and its signals. The study of the brain has proven it to be the center of cognition not the heart but it took all of human history to come to that consensus. Neuron sends through axons receives through dendrites. Action potentials are sent and these only vary in number not amplitude like Morse code without the dashes just the dots. All neurons communicate with 10k others and there are 100bn total neurons. Simple communication power lies in connections and complex interactions. Neurons are sensory motor or inter neurons. One for sight ect the other for muscle action the last acting as the connective tissue between neurons. The brain is a network of networks in many ways but it’s obviously more complex but hubs activities for functions and spokes makes some logical sense. Everything we experience in the world is a creation of our brain. Neurons have special functions a neuron area discerns lines and thus was discovered by accident through curiosity and the scientists win a Nobel prize for this accident. The brain can solve and fill in things or block out things through its blind spots. Think the gorilla experiment but it also works the opposite way when you don’t have the full picture. Many different complex areas of the brain. When we are asked to imagine something our visual neurons fire. This is an example of how complex the brain is. There is so much that goes into the brains perception even if it seems basic. Vision is a cognitive process we don’t just see we see as. Like seeing someone hitting on our girlfriend is more than just visual perception it’s a lot of reactions.

**Note:** Comprehensive overview of consciousness problem including qualia, awareness, and the hard problem of subjective experience

> Consciousness could be an immaterial principle, like the soul colluding with the body, a vapor injecting life into you a physical form of consciousness sent from the brain of the body physical manifestation of consciousness, the third is to ignore and accept the world as it is. Our bodies and our personalities change, but we have one consciousness so it’s clear we are changing. Lock argued, consciousness is memory awareness, and self interest for the future. You are privy to yourself and know yourself to be you. It made memory the basis of identity vs the previously believed opposite idea. Awareness is of an object of attention and the state of being in that quality. Contrast states are directed upon something like the breath in meditation. Second type is Qualia, the states of being experienced properties and feeling and the safe of consciousness what it feels like to be in pain to see a red dress or drink a beer. The experience of Qualia is phenomenal consciousness. The subject can introspect the feeling too. We can also just access consciousness without monitoring it like being in flow. Consciousness goal is when a 3rd party can understand conscious states without any first person introspection or input. 3rd person brain states align behavior with a brain. This is the grail of understanding consciousness. One model of consciousness is the brain web model of neural networks with different areas processing different info. Info becomes conscious when neural circuits that represent info are mobilized by top down intentional amplification by a brain scale state of coherence that involves many distributed neurons. Brain workspace says consciousness is a function of integration at a global level of activity. This is a functional definition but doesn’t explain Qualia.

Consciousness and defining what something is like is a key for physicalists theories. We can know a brain perceives red but until we actually see red a part of our understanding is lost or incomplete. They reason that Qualia creates a gap of interpretation and physicalist theories can’t explain Qualia. There is this gap that exists between physical and psychological that we haven’t solved yet.

**Note:** Minds are more than brains - they're brains in environment, requiring context for understanding consciousness

> Likely to understand minds we need to understand the wider environment we can look at neurons to see someone is looking at a tree but we actually still need to know what a tree is to have context. This is true with everything in life. We don’t just see but see as so to understand the mind we need a broad approach. We are more than neurochemistry can’t understand everything from that. We react differently to moral and immoral things but because morality is relative there is a factor outside our minds. Minds are more than brains they are shaped by their environment. The idea of the self being was an enlightenment idea of Locke around an integrated person that changed societies perspective. Democratized the self. This came with the death of the self as well from Spinoza who said we can be held or enthralled in unclear unconscious or half conscious ideas. We can only free ourselves when we understand these ideas clearly which frees ourselves. Understanding what has a hold on your mind to get out of your mental prison. Free ourselves and seek truth. We also need to understand how we’re at the center of our own universe and that perception. Why is a sense of self and feeling we are feeling so central to human experience. Then we have a feeling of knowing. Levels of consciousness like core the animalistic self and extended consciousness the autobiographical self. Our conscious brain tries to make sense of innate reactions post reaction. We think we saw a snake we get a reflex triggered first then we have to explain it. Narrative fallacy. Gambler fallacy also an example of this fallacy.

One can make a program but we can’t jump to universality without truly understanding he underlying mechanics. We can’t program creativity until we know what it is
Analogs to the turing test how can you perfectly replicate something you don’t know but also you can basically do it. Does thinking and inventions of idea come from synthesis and analogs or does it what is human creativity and thinking. What is true creative thought. Does turning a rolling tree into a wheel count as thought or does putting something on the rolling tree just count as thought or is it all thought into the car from the carridge or do you just say lets take the buggy and put a motor in it which already exists and we will have a car and better yet lets use the manufacturing facilities we already have to build them at scale so there is no real thinking here or creativity yet there is a bunch of real thinking and creativity here so what gives. What is going on here. Similarly with thinking fast and slow that is how we avoid bias and it walks us through some of how we trick ourselves but not how we creatively think. The whole point of phycology is figuring out where humans are obviously wrong not where humans are obviously right because its so hard to figure out why humans are obviously right.

> Memory for different things like childhood memory spacial memory what you did yesterday is in different places and there is a benefit to forgetting to allow things to come into the mind. Like old people not remembering breakfast but the war. Different kind and uses of memory some is procedural and some is more rote like a phone number. We can forget because we didn’t receive the information right or forget for effiency. Possible to try to forget but unclear. Forgetting is tied with false remembering when you prompt people with ideas like bed night ect. And they swear you said sleep when you never did. Recovered memory therapy has issues because it’s so easy to convince ourselves of things that never happened we can do easily fabricate experiences in our minds that never happened and swear they did that is why people are so influencable. None of the stories regarding this therapy have been coroberated. This shows how easily we fool ourselves to our detriment. Confabulation isn’t lying because you swear it’s true. We as neuroscientists understand that events leave imprints on our brains but don’t know how or where and can’t see it. We must assume we don’t know where these are yet but eventually can understand it with time. We are basically reductionist in the conclusion of understanding all brain activity by the brain. This minimizes the ability for bodily complex interactions and emergent phenomena by saying it’s just the brain. We mauve can’t understand the feeling of consciousness from just looking at neurons. What does being in a state mean some people think these states are similar to demonic possession in older terms and these states can be understood with chemicals. Others argue these states of mind are complexly connected and are indespensible cannot be thrown out. Theories of mind like a cat meow near the bowl mean it wants food reduces complex thought to simple models creating value that may be indiscernible to even an expert in an mri. These models of thought have proved very beneficial for many mental phenomena theory of mind helped understand autism and then we could map that onto areas of the brain in some regard. Good place to start. Both approaches have their uses. Neuroscience is exposed to so many cognitive biases because the space is so small and unclear so we need to be actively very skeptical and maintain doubt always. But everyone knows this so it’s not flying under the radar meaning it has a less horrible biased effect.

##### 9. Some Thoughts on Human-Ai Relationships and How We're Approaching Them...

**Note:** Modern perspective on AI consciousness debate - separating ontological from perceived consciousness

> Ultimately, these conversations are rarely about the entities we project onto. They’re about us: our tendencies, expectations, and the kinds of relationships we want to cultivate. This perspective anchors how we approach one of the more fraught questions which I think is currently just outside the Overton window, but entering soon: AI consciousness.

Untangling “AI consciousness”

“Consciousness” is a loaded word, and discussions can quickly turn abstract. If users were to ask our models on whether they’re conscious, our stance as outlined in the Model Spec is for the model to acknowledge the complexity of consciousness – highlighting the lack of a universal definition or test, and to invite open discussion. (*Currently, our models don't fully align with this guidance, often responding "no" instead of addressing the nuanced complexity. We're aware of this and working on model adherence to the Model Spec in general.)

The response might sound like we’re dodging the question, but we think it’s the most responsible answer we can give at the moment, with the information we have.

To make this discussion clearer, we’ve found it helpful to break down the consciousness debate to two distinct but often conflated axes:

1. Ontological consciousness: Is the model actually conscious, in a fundamental or intrinsic sense? Views range from believing AI isn't conscious at all, to fully conscious, to seeing consciousness as a spectrum on which AI sits, along with plants and jellyfish.

2. Perceived consciousness: How conscious does the model seem, in an emotional or experiential sense? Perceptions range from viewing AI as mechanical like a calculator or autocomplete, to projecting basic empathy onto nonliving things, to perceiving AI as fully alive – evoking genuine emotional attachment and care.

Into your office and spends a week tearing apart your business. What do you think he would say is the worst part of the Robinhood business today? After all this improvement that happened after 2022?

Speaker 1
I mean, I think there's a lot of things that are still not perfect. And we're on the journey of making them better. Yeah. For example, there's probably still a little bit too much bureaucracy, a little bit too much process, or maybe like 25% of the way to building the company that I want to build from a culture Standpoint. And maybe I should articulate what that is. So some things I believe we want to have a relatively small number of the highest quality people. I would rather have a small number of just elite people that I pay more. It sounds obvious, but not a lot of people in my space believe this. And actually, a lot of the incumbents in public companies, if you look at it, they invest heavily in offshoring, which is having large and large numbers of low cost mediocre people. And there's a benefit to that to a certain extent. But my preference would be a small number of amazing people that are elite in their fields that we compensate very, very well. And I just think for me personally, I would have more fun being in that environment. I think people around me will have more fun. And if you're in small groups of elite people, they kind of push each other and the end result is better than what they could do individually, which I don't think is the case for people That are less talented. So that's one thing. I want as little bureaucracy as possible. Things should be effortless to do here. It should be a joy to deploy code and get products to customers. And I want compensation to be sort of close to perfectly tied to performance. So it's very, very clear who's getting promoted and who's not based on how well you're achieving your goals and doing the things that you're supposed to be doing and setting out to do. And in particular, I want to de-emphasize, I think a lot of times when we think about promotions and leveling and recruiting outside people, one of the common things that people look For is the scope of their existing role, which translates into how big of a team did they lead. Oh, if someone has led a team of a thousand people, surely they're good enough for Robin Hood, where they can lead a team of 500 people or more. I think at a lot of companies that creates an incentive to hire empire builders that are inefficient. And what I instead want is someone that's done big things with as few people as possible. Those are kind of the North stars, a culture of high performance, top talent in person. I think in person is valuable. And I'd say I'm remote tolerant, but I don't think the future is fully remote and distributed companies, at least while humans are involved. I mean, maybe if we get to mathematical super intelligence, things will look different. I think there's a huge benefit. And I think if Frank Slootman came in, I don't know exactly what he would say, but I'd say we're maybe like 25 or 30% along these journeys and there's still ways we can improve. I don't think there's anything major that hasn't been started yet.

Summary:
Effective leadership fosters growth by allowing individuals to take initiative and learn through experience, rather than simply providing solutions.

Organizations that centralize planning stifle creativity and limit the potential of their workforce, leading to stagnation and inefficiency. In contrast, nimble startups thrive by promoting innovation and execution from all levels, highlighting the risks of hierarchical management structures that resemble small socialist states, where only a few dictate the flow of ideas and plans.

For meaningful engagement and fulfillment, employees must be empowered to contribute, rather than marginalized as passive participants.

And instead of teaching them, you know, they're obviously when you teach somebody, when you let them do something they've never done before, they're going to make mistakes. And so the troop leaders like, oh, you know, all set up the tent. I will do all the cooking. I will start the fire. They're essentially just sitting around useless. And he says, we watched other troops cooking stew, making fires, setting up TPs and rope bridges. While we sat around at the end of a few years, nobody was above the rank of second class scout in our troop. Today, I probably couldn't survive in the woods for more than a few hours." And he immediately translates that lesson to what he observed in his multi-decade career. Too many business organizations practice central planning to the extent that the creativity of their people is effectively 95% curtailed. And he rails against this because he was taught that this is better management, and he clearly does not agree with this. Businesses that become large and quote unquote better manage saw their markets and profits eaten up by nimble startup firms with great ideas and efficient execution. Many large companies resemble small socialist states. Ideas and plans all come from the top. The majority of the workers are treated differently than the top planners and most of the workers receive little or no self-fulfillment in their jobs.

> Episode AI notes

1. Organizations can choose between a permission culture and a constraint culture, which significantly affects decision-making and growth potential.

2. A constraint culture empowers individuals by providing clear boundaries, fostering innovation and creativity, while permission culture often paralyzes initiative.

3. People frequently hesitate to make decisions due to reliance on structures and fear of consequences; embracing agency is crucial.

4. Understanding the difference between type one (irreversible) and type two (reversible) decisions helps alleviate anxiety regarding decision permanence.

5. An iterative mindset is essential, as most decisions can be adjusted; practicing a structured decision-making approach improves quality and accountability.

6. Retrospectives provide valuable learning opportunities, akin to the satisfaction of exercise, and require a culture of open communication to be effective.

7. Engaging questions and structured dialogue during retrospectives encourage meaningful conversations and idea exchange.

8. Implementing insights from retrospectives necessitates a clear strategy; creating agreements can help turn insights into actionable changes.

9. Identifying barriers to performance allows teams to explore possibilities and fosters a culture open to innovation.

10. Shifting focus from financial incentives to organizational culture encourages a work environment conducive to innovation.

11. Small percentages of engaged individuals within an organization can drive significant cultural change, with gradual efforts often being more effective than abrupt shifts.

> The Role of Judgment in Team Success

Key takeaways:
- Failure often occurs when decision-making becomes judgment-based and lacks solid rationale, numbers, or authority.
- The judgment of the leader plays a crucial role in differentiating between a good team and a great team.
- The clarity and philosophy behind how a team makes decisions are important factors for success.
- Willingness to bend rules, within ethical boundaries, can indicate a team's ability to think critically and adapt.
- High agency among individual contributors is vital for teams to creatively execute and influence outcomes.

Speaker 2
I think one of the reasons that it fails is because it becomes judgment-based. And as much as people like to say that they make judgment decisions, they don't actually like to make judgment decisions because they like to have a lot of rationale behind or numbers Behind or authority behind why they make a decision. And when the judgment is subjective, in this case, you have a tiebreaker, somebody has to be an arbitrator of that, whether it's the founder or somebody up the line. But what they're really doing is they're exercising judgment. And that's where you get a lot of leverage from. When that judgment's correct, it's really powerful and when it's not correct, it can destroy a company. Absolutely.

Speaker 1
I like to observe that, you know, there's a difference between very good teams that operate quite well and really great teams. The teams that are not only able to operate quite well on one project, but on multiple projects and are able to cross-pollinate their goodness to other teams that they work with. One of my observations about the core difference between a good team and a great team is the judgment of the leader of that team.

Speaker 2
What other observations do you have about the difference between a good and a great team?

Speaker 1
The first one is really the best way to describe it is what is their clarity on how this team makes decisions. And I mean it certainly from a tactical kind of process perspective, but I mean it more from a almost a philosophical perspective, right, which is that. You know, what are we optimizing for? And if you look at all those sort of like, you know, the great companies out there, right, like they have some way of deciding what makes sense, what product to build and how to build the Product, how much attention to detail to give certain things and how much to build fast, right. And hopefully some of those are codified in the operating values or the operating principles of the company. But does this team have clarity on that kind of philosophy for how they're making decisions? Is I think a really important factor? And then are they actually following through on it in their day to day? So that is one thing I like to call out. Second thing I like to call out is to what degree is the team willing to bend rules, right. I'm not talking about like breaking laws because you shouldn't do that, but to what degree are you willing to bend rules? And there are teams that like want to do the right thing that will follow all the rules, right. And they do it for two reasons. One is there is usually kind of, you know, a little bit, perhaps some insecurity, perhaps a lack of adequate courage on the part of the leaders of the team. But the other is being able to defend when things go wrong, right. So, you know, following rules is very comfortable because if we follow all the rules and it doesn't work out, we can just point at the rules and say, look, we followed all the rules, we Followed the process, we came to all the product reviews, we showed you all the mockups and all the intermediate artifacts as the rules said, right. And so therefore now if this product failed in the market or failed to win, don't blame me, right. Like I followed the rules, right. And this is how a lot of operators operate in organizations.

Speaker 2
I call that the McDonald's problem because, you know, I used to work in tech as well and people would do this all the time where it's like, I followed all the rules, I got the wrong outcome. And I would say, well, if all you do is follow the rules, you should be getting minimum wage because what we're paying you for is judgment. You need to know when to opt out when that doesn't make sense or where it's leading down the wrong path and that drove people crazy.

Speaker 1
Yep, yep, yep, it's so interesting that people don't see that the reason they're getting paid the big bucks is, and the way they'll create alpha for their team or for their company is Through that judgment, right. Because if everybody could just follow playbooks, then, you know, and they might be wonderful playbooks, but over time even wonderful playbooks become the industry standard. So now if you want to outperform, you need something else and that something else is always judgment. And so, yeah, absolutely, you know, that kind of like willingness to bend rules. And now the question is kind of, well, how do I know which rules to bend, right. That's the next question I get. When I write about these things, it's like, again, it goes back to judgment. One, you know, I have quite a few on the list of like the attributes of, you know, good to great teams, but another one I'll share that is often not discussed is just, you know, high agency Among the individual contributors of the team. Because I think like at some point, you know, a team, say it's like 10, 20, 30, 40 people, 50 people more, it becomes really important, not just for the leaders to be ambitious and have Good judgment and so on, but for the individual contributors to be very high agency people, where they feel that they have the ability to end the sort of desire to influence outcomes, Right. And they are going to execute creatively to do that. And in some cases, they are going to bend rules. And in many cases, you know, most teams have constraints, right, whether they're staffing constraints or funding constraints or whatever else. And it's this ability of at least a few individuals on the team. You don't need the entire team to be extremely high agency, but the ability of at least a few individuals on the team to have an embody this high agency approach such that, oh, actually, Yes, we do have this obstacle, but here's how we're going to creatively execute around that obstacle in order to make impact. So those would be a few, you know, items I would share in terms of kind of that difference between, you know, good and great teams.

**Note:** Trust built through truth and accountability - if truth is primary value, trust accelerates with culture accepting failure

> Trust Builds Through Truth and Accountability

Summary:
Building trust within an organization requires working with trustworthy individuals and consistently demonstrating reliability.

It's crucial to convey that not everything will succeed, yet trusting in people's abilities accelerates the development of trust. Distinguishing between conventional opinions and true correctness, grounded in first principles, fosters a culture where diversity of thought is encouraged.

Organizations should prioritize actual truth over consensus to avoid mediocrity and political dynamics.

Encouraging members to present their ideas, even if they challenge existing projects, contributes to a more engaged community.

The concept of the 'trust battery' emphasizes the significance of micro-interactions, where the collective perception of correctness within the community shapes trust dynamics. Ultimately, if truth is the primary value, trust can flourish at an accelerated pace, coupled with a culture that accepts failure as part of the growth process.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
I'd love to close and collect all of these ideas together into a final question. What's really standing out in my memory from the conversation is these exothermic people, the role of heat inside of organizations, the role of hopefully getting those people on an Island somewhere to build something with variance, with uniqueness to it. These are beautiful ideas. Shopify is one of them. Maybe you had a little detour there for a couple of years in years 11 and 12 of Zerp, but you're back. So you've got one and it's big and there's a lot of people there and it serves a lot of people. How do you build trust inside an organization at this scale? Because for this to keep going, that seems like the core element that you need. And I'm curious how you do it.

Speaker 1
Work with people deserving of trust and repeatedly show that they come through whenever you trust them. Explain why this is non-negotiable and also explain that this is not everything has to succeed. Actually, people build more trust with me quicker than they disagree with something and are right, or at least right based on everything they know, and then articulate that. And then we can have a conversation about why this still isn't correct and what perspective they might not have missed. I love these conversations. I think you have to have a culture, but the important thing is what is your definition of right actually? Yeah. Because I've learned that a lot of people's definition of right is actually the opinion that most people hold is the right opinion. You're trying to converge on the consensus decision. I think that's deadly. I think that's a fitness function of the mainstream again. It can't be a fitness function of your island. Your fitness function of your island, I think if you're trying to be different and you're trying to be on the good side of different, aka better than mainstream, you need to make actual True correctness the thing. So I think when people are correct in a first principle sense and are willing to say so, even if it's inconvenient, what happens next is the thing that really shapes your culture. If that is appreciated, you're going to go places. If that isn't, then you're dealing with either wrong assumptions about the culture by some people or politicking. So that is very important that that doesn't work. So then it becomes a way for people to help themselves to having opinions that's distributed, because again, is it true? Is the thing that's important? And that allows people to step out of the org chart and just put up their hands saying, I've got something here and know that this is going to be going well for them, even if it contradicts Potentially what the project has been doing before. It's also lots and lots of interactions. I do have an entire thing on the trust battery. It's micro interactions too. I think the big one is what is the opinion about correctness, about truth and about right that is at the core of a particular community that you are part of. And again, if it's truth, then trust can be built across the company at a fairly high rate. And then the cost of failure has to be very, very low there.

> Trust and Mission Focus Fuel Team Success

Summary:
Successful teams thrive on high levels of trust and a focused mission.

Trust allows team members to communicate openly and provide immediate feedback, fostering a supportive environment where everyone commits to shared goals. A strong leader is crucial in creating trust by removing uncertainty and clearly defining roles.

In challenging situations, teams that maintain trust and mission focus excel while those that lack these qualities often crumble.

Individual motivation plays a key role; great teams are driven by selflessness and the desire to be part of something larger, enabling members to overcome personal doubts.

The journey to achieving team goals often involves confronting and addressing self-doubt and external pressures, which can hinder performance and enjoyment of the game. A healthy perspective, coupled with fearlessness and selflessness, can lead to transformation and success, especially when guided by inspiring leadership.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
Yeah, I know. But thinking about the threads, the common threads between those teams, and something I talk a lot about with anyone who will listen is, those teams are marked by high trust and high What I call mission focus. Right? The trust was instant. We were able to talk to each other, look each other in the eye, and the feedback was instantaneous. Because we trusted we all had each other's back, we had the best interest, because we were here for one reason, and that was to raise a banner. And that's where the mission focus comes in. And everyone is rowing in the same direction. And when you have an environment, and from the coach, from the teams to the managers, assistant coaches, everybody associated with that run has ultimate trust and ultimate focus on Why we're here. Amazing, amazing things happen. And you don't understand that until adversity hits. And that's the other common theme, right? I've been on some great teams when adversity hits, they crumble because they lack mission focus, because they lack trust. And so you never know when you're going to have to lean on those two things, but those are the two most important factors in the successful cohesive team.

Speaker 4
Maybe just to pick on the first example you said, what allowed that trust to exist at that Duke team? Like what was the trust is great. I think everyone wants that and it's an amazing feeling, but how did you get it?

Speaker 2
Well, Coach K obviously is my mind, the greatest basketball coach, greatest coach in sports. And there are a lot of things that cause uncertainty in teams or cause mistrust. Uncertainty is one of them. When you have a strong leader that, that removes uncertainty and look, Coach K did a great job of defining roles, but also given a space to, to take ownership in the team. And there was no doubt every day we walked into the locker room why we were there. All right? And that's to be the best team possible to improve every single day. And if we do that, championships and winnings are a byproduct of that. Right? And so we were almost freed by expectations. Everyone said, was it a super high pressure? No, it wasn't high pressure because it was very simple daily goals of getting better, playing together, trusting each other, looking each other in the eye. It sounds super corny, but that was the expectation. And the uncertainty was removed from why we were there.

Speaker 1
We're free. Alex, what team came to mind for you? Thinking back to my college days, like that, you know, and I played for Urban, who was a, you know, I would almost call like a psychologist as much as a coach. And I think there's a, there's certainly selflessness is one of the first things that comes to mind. And I think where you could put that with trust right like the mission focus like the team's bigger than us right and everybody thinks that. For any great team, right? That again, they, and you want that. And I think at the core of everybody, you want to be a part of something bigger than yourself, right? Like, that's why you're there. That's why you're willing to sacrifice and do so much. And I think at the core of that comes the motivation from a good place. And I'm fascinated around motivation because I grew up and I never imagined in my wildest dreams I'd play professional sports. I was like too realistic a kid, right? Like I just heard the odds. It's not in the cards for me. I grew up a very normal kid. I wasn't like a crazy standout by any means growing up. And I had one college scholarship offer, right? And that was my dream. My dream growing up, like I loved Saturdays. Like I loved college football. I loved, again, getting your education, the idea of the student athlete running out on the field and like the student section going crazy and that relationship with the student section. And we're all part of this great big culture that we've been craving, right? And you're just a role in that and getting your education and obviously then moving, you know, with your life. And like one school gave me that opportunity. And there certainly when I got there was this, you know, I had it along with probably everybody else there that like, were we good enough, right? Like was I deserving of this? Was I good enough? And certainly we all embodied that. And this comes back to urban, we all had an edge. The entire team had an edge, had something to prove. And so I took the field with a fearlessness every single game like, like, you know, I like fuck you like I, you know, excuse my language, like I'm, I'm out here to do something, right? And I don't care, I wasn't worried about making a mistake. No one was expecting anything anyway. I think we played with an edge as a team and were out to do something. We were a little school in the Mountain West. At the time they had this PCS thing and we wanted to be the first school. They didn't allow us in the club and we wanted to break the wall down. And that was the goal, and everybody was rowing in the same direction. And you woke up with a singular focus every day that that's what we wanted to go do, and it was important to all of us. And then to go achieve it, obviously, you know, it's like the best feeling in sports, right, to be accountable. Like to quickly flip on that, it was, you know, it was only months later that I got drafted with the number one overall pick. And everything changed for me. Everything changed. Right? And like that courage that I took the field with, that fearlessness that our entire team embodied, like I didn't have that anymore. And in fact, I was on the other side of it. Like I was the expectations were so great. I Had so much self-doubt Right that like I was in over my head that and I was Scared to death like I thought I had to be perfect and I was scared to death to make a mistake and I walked out Onto The field I did and I did everything not just on the field. Like I everything tiptoed around on eggshells.

Speaker 4
It was so burdensome, the weight that I walked around in, and it never left. Can you zoom in on that a little bit? I suspect almost nobody has experienced this sort of external pressure that you had and you're talking about like the world, you know, watching and aware of your performance. But I also suspect that basically everyone listening has had some period of extraordinary self-doubt and it's hard to get through. Zoom in on like the emotions and like what that was literally like. Like, did you feel that in the shower? Did you feel that lying in bed?

Speaker 1
Do you have trouble sleeping? Like how did it manifest? All the time. Yeah. Laying in bed at night, having dinner with my friends or girlfriend at the time who became my wife Certainly at the facility and

Taylor’s goal was networking most notably to build the intergalactic network between all arpa computers. Larry Roberts became the head of this networking team a close friend of southerland who may have invented the first neural network and while the research people didn’t respect Taylor he had Wes Clark and lick and was able to get 1mm from the director of arpa to do his project in a 15 minute meeting. The idea was they would build a network through terminals connected to routers based on packet switching the community was first against this then go excited at the technical challenge. Vietnam was in the air but this never lost funding because while arpa struggled the network always appealed well to the director.

Summary:
Strong teams prioritize relationships and a culture of belonging over mere performance metrics.

Successful leadership involves investing in players' well-being and fostering an environment where teammates support each other, creating lasting bonds. Culture is built through actions and values rather than mere words, emphasizing team-first principles.

The experience of belonging leads to meaningful memories, enriching both personal lives and community ties.

Ultimately, the joy of shared experiences matters more than winning, as these connections are what endure beyond the season.

Speaker 1
There were three polls at the beginning of the season. We were ranked 12, 11 and 12. There's 12 teams. We were the easy game in everybody's schedule. Fast forward. We are playing game seven of the finals tomorrow night. And it's been the craziest, most fun ride. And you know what? I realized, Patrick, I had never owned a toy as an adult, a toy where you literally do it for the pleasure of it. And the connections, the ability to bring a philosophical approach to this, the relationships, running it in a very different way, investing differently. All came through in the middle of the season, not wearing the finals, say, this is my favorite team I've ever been a part of. And it's all culture. At the end of the day, Patrick, we all want to belong to places that we feel connected to. And the magic of organizations is understanding that. And in this world, we are so disconnected from so many things. People no longer belong to civic groups or churches or all of this. And the ability to create connections. Look, this town is going crazy. Win or loss, it didn't lose. It doesn't matter. It's like, it's so good. Like if you go through the year, go back to your calendar and say, what are the things that I'm going to remember 10 years from now? You'll be shocked how few they are. If you're lucky, you have six, seven, usually experiences, usually things that are either surprising and it involves different things. And it's a really good exercise to do because you're like, okay, how do I do more of those? I need to design that into my calendar. I tell you, I have like three of them that are going to show up at the end of the year, including two nights ago when we're down 10 with two and a half minutes, game six on the road, we send it To overtime. We're going to double overtime and we win. I can't sleep the whole night. I have a leadership meeting yesterday, which I am completely exhausted for. And it was the greatest thing ever.

Speaker 2
So it's been awesome. So tell me what you did. How did the culture change? What is the culture of the team? Like I went and asked everybody and don't for change Someone told me that you called and we're talking in the locker room to every player, one on one, you are involved. This is not something that you're just phoning in.

Speaker 1
I've been in Puerto Rico nine times, and I can literally go hold down for two games and run back, so I just get so much joy out of it. It's just uncomfortable to talk about that. OK, now I'll give you a little bit. The first practice we show up, all these players are looking at like, okay, new owner, players don't trust owners, they get treated like merchandise, they get lied to, they get all this Stuff. They're very skeptical. So you can't show up and say, hey, we're going to build a culture of this and that and the other. So I showed up and said, look, there's literally three rules here. We are going to invest in you so that you can make more money out of your career here or anywhere. And here's what that means. We put in a full weight room. We put in a bunch of staff. They're looking at us like a little bit like incredulous. It's like, we're going to do this. Number two is we're actually not going to care about the goal. Teams have goals. You know, this is someone saying, franchises have systems. We're gonna build a system, and we're gonna play in a certain way, and we're gonna do certain things, and then there's nobody that is above the team. So this is a team first and all of that, and we for the treble later, a lot of this, and we signed a big free agent. I think it was two or three days later we fired him, because he was a jerk. Culture is what you tolerate, it's not what you preach. Our best player we suspended and never told anybody because he was not behaving in a way that was culture-fest. He begged to come back, he's the most amazing teammate. This guy says I've never been part of a team, these kids get treated like whatever. So great teams, great teams in anything in life. It is team first. Because most places are player first. Exceptional teams that where they exceed their expectations, where we are, we are like the eighth best team, not the second or first best team, is when there's teammates first. These guys, the love that they feel for each other is beautiful. And the great thing about teams back to community is like, once you are part of an experience like that, the team will end, you will be teammates for life. And that to me is the beautiful part of all of this. Regardless how that story ends, and this may have been our lucky season, we may never make it again. It does not matter. No one there's a saying in Spanish, ¿No me puede quita lo hay lao? Nadi a me quita lo hay lao que quiereso? You can never take away the songs I've danced. We go to the games, all my friends are sitting in the friend's row. Like, it is literally a reunion of high school there and it's just beautiful. It's just beautiful. Towns are so passionate. It's crazy the love that they have for the game. There's a parade on Saturday to celebrate our championship. I hope we win.

Speaker 2
How could I watch this game?

Speaker 1
It's on YouTube actually. It was like 50,000 people on YouTube in the US watching the last one.

Speaker 2
Incredible. Oh man, I hope you win. But it doesn't matter. Like he says. It doesn't matter.

Speaker 1
It's a game. There's no winning. We want it ready.

Speaker 2
It lets me jump back to our list 39 to 57 on leadership.

**Type:** inclusive_philosophy  

**Note:** Be nice when it's cheap - golden rule approach creates Pareto improvements and cooperative culture

> Be Nice When It's Cheap

Summary:
Embrace a mindset of inclusivity and kindness, especially when it is easy to do.

This principle encourages offering help without significant cost to oneself, fostering a culture of generosity. Emphasizing the Golden Rule, treat others, including AIs and non-humans, as you wish to be treated, which can promote cooperation and improve communal well-being.

The approach of being nice when it's cheap can lead to significant positive outcomes, known as Pareto improvements, by creating numerous beneficial interactions.

Ultimately, cultivating a pluralistic perspective aids in establishing structures that accommodate diverse value systems and agents, aiming for a harmonious and mature civilization.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
Is the inclusivity because of part of your values includes your different potential futures getting to play out? Or is it because I'm uncertain about which the right one is? So let's make sure we're not nulling out the possible, if you're wrong, you're not nulling out all value. I think it's a bunch of things at once.

Speaker 1
So yeah, I'm really into being nice when it's cheap, right? Like I think if you can just help someone a lot in a way that's really cheap for you, do it. Or like, I don't know. Obviously you need to think about trade-offs and there's like a lot of people in principle you could be nice to. But I think like the principle of like be nice when it's cheap, I'm like very excited to try to uphold. I also really hope that kind of other people uphold that with respect to me, including the AIs, right? Like I think we should be kind of golden ruling. Like we're thinking about, oh, we're going to inventing these AIs. Like I think there's some way in which I'm trying to like kind of embody attitudes towards them that I like hope that they would embody towards me. And that's like some, it's unclear exactly what the ground of that is, but that's something, you know, I really liked the golden rule. And I think, and I think a lot about that as a kind of basis for treatment of other beings. And so I think like be nice when it's cheap is like, if you think about it, if everyone implements that rule, then we get potentially like a big kind of Pareto improvement or like, so, I Don't know, exactly Pareto improvement, it's like good deal. It's a lot of good deals. And yeah, so I think it's that I'm just into pluralism. I've got uncertainty, you know, there's like all sorts of stuff swimming around there, but, and then I think also just as a matter of like having kind of cooperative and kind of good balances Of power and deals and kind of avoiding conflict, I think like finding to set up structures that lots and lots of people and value systems and agents are happy with, including non-humans, You know, people in the past, AIs, animals, like, I really think we should be like, we should have very broad sweep in thinking about what sorts of inclusivity we want to be of reflecting In a kind of mature civilization and kind of setting ourselves up for doing that.

All arguments are relevant 4. Best source is tradition as these have been tested for a longer time but these should still be tested and criticized 5. Knowledge doesn’t start blank but builds on previous knowledge usually we’re kinda right 6. Pessimistic and optimistic in the blind sense are both wrong 7. Errors help us learn. Observation and reason aren’t authority. These help to find truth 8. Every solution of a problem raises new harder problems we become less ignorant but our world expands. Our knowledge is finite ignorance infinite. Truth is beyond human authority.

**Note:** Being stricter reveals broken models - seizing signs of breakage instead of looking away enables paradigm transcendence

> One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect.  To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.  The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.

> Falsifiability for popper could be viewed the same way confirmation is as it brings you one step closer or farther and falsifiability isn’t a death sentence but a correction. Good science builds on work before. We need to be aware of our biases inherent in our models and limited world view. How the world appears to us is a construct of our cognitive capacities. Kant. The world we perceive is conditioned by the manner of us perceiving it. Perception vs interpretation tools in the right people’s hands. A physicist sees the world clearly through the complex tools at cern that adds to their perception but to us those are just nonsense number. Cognition influenced by our previous experience and cognitive capacities. What we know influences experience interpretation is experience. We look through all our past experiences and project those onto the current moment and observation. That allows us to understand what that thing means which is unique to us. The possession of our cognitive architecture gives us the possibility for interpretation of experience. Provides the initial conditions for thought. This may make understanding the quantum realm harder because our normal experience is in the classical world and the quantum world is so far outside our lexicon of perception. He’s arguing here that seeing the world through our models and perceptions may bind us from fully seeing the world. When you look at the world through parliament ect. This thing doesn’t exist but it runs the country. If we all agreed it wasn’t a thing then it would disappear such he argues with our perception. We can see the quantum world with our brains but we just need to create models and tools that give us a different perspective and perception to do so properly. We aren’t unable physically but unwilling to reconstruct our perception bottoms up which might be needed.

Translation is when the opposite paradigm needs to be adapted into another groups language of science first. This means it will not be truly theirs until they adopt the vernacular or the Method under their language. Sometime people will adapt new languages and models without realizing if they have passed many tests still others will accept the new science but wiuthoyt knowledge of the native language be forever outsiders to the area of study because their beliefs might change but their internal models are calibrated another way to make them incompatible no matter what

Before this no one had both, and Copernicus knew all that could be known using his materials about the heavens. What changed there was a benefit of simplicity making theories more simple better science. Two big things were what had previously been believed, could be false. And progress came from collecting a facts patiently and testing of theories. And bold conjectures that combine facts. Kepler discovered more of patients and analysis of data than genius. changing the motion of planets from ellipses to circles change the idea that these were perfect things as the circle was a perfect shape into something that was more realistic. This changed the frame of thinking. Dial came up with the idea of falling bodies at the same speed. The mob was all the professors of philosophy and their dogmatism, and hated the telescope, because it showed more heavenly bodies than the assumed seven which was a perfect number. The idea of law was in men’s head, and sorcery was dismissed. The unmoved mover was cut out by laws of motion pushing god out of the thinking. Newton believed in absolute space and time we believe in relativity now.

### The Ladder vs. The Spectrum (Thinking About Thinking)

**Slug:** `the-ladder-vs-the-spectrum-thinking-about-thinking`

#### Description

Framework for evaluating thinking styles and truth-seeking rigor - distinguishing between what we think (spectrum) and how we think (ladder)

**Author:** Tim Urban  
**Relevance:** 10/10  
**Quality:** 9.8/10  
**Type:** foundational_concept  

**Note:** Perfect foundational explanation of the ladder vs spectrum framework - the spectrum is WHAT we think while the ladder is HOW we think. High rung seeks truth over being right in the long term, while low rung wants to win in the moment. This is the core concept.

> Idea spectrum range of what people believe thank you and their stances. This reduces complex topics to readily digestible pieces but in that they provides a good framework. Idea spectrum example US is the best country do US does a lot well but it has issues the US does a little well but it’s mostly bad the us is terrible The ladder is how we think the spectrum is what we think. The High rung is about getting to truth and the low rung is about being consistent with your beliefs Scientist want to form a hypothesis by understanding what is out there and then evaluating it. Gather info is about quantity and evaluating it is about quality and trusting the info source. Trusting indirect knowledge is vital. Trust when placed well creates knowledge that compounds but when placed poorly creates the illusion of knowledge which is worse than no knowledge Form a hypothesis and then test it. And improve it. These people are terrified of being wrong but this fuels their fire to find truth because they want to be right over the long run not in the moment. Thinking like a sports fan is motivated reasoning but there is still a desire for truth do you want the game to be played fairly and the best team to win but you also want your team to win and have a vested interest so you’re not completely unbiased but you still have integrity to first principles of the game Thinking like an attorney you have a client who you need to work for and it’s just about winning for them and cherry picking evidence so your idea looks right it’s not about truth it’s about making one-sided arguments for specifically your vested interest even if you’re morally on the wrong side you don’t care. Shut off your ability and desire to see anything that is not your side in court this works well because both sides are stealmanning their argument then impartial judge makes a decision but in your head it’s just a corrupt court room with both sides saying the same thing. They still respect some form of knowledge gathering Thinking like a zealot every idea is your baby and tied to your identity and you won’t believe anything against it because it’s an attack on you

> The Dangers of Low Rung Thinking

Key takeaways:
- Low rung thinking blocks learning and leads to repeated mistakes.
- Asking oneself if there is anything that would make them say they are wrong can help identify low rung thinking.
- Getting irrationally angry when someone disagrees may indicate low rung thinking.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Well, I think partially is just being like even just having this ladder is a concept in your head, because no one wants to be on the low rungs, right? When you're on the low rungs, you're delusional. You are letting kind of primitive emotions make your decisions. You're completely blocked from learning new things. You will continue to make the same mistake over and over because of stubborn kind of insistence that you're right. So it's not good for the person who suffers most from low rung thinking is the low rung thinker. And so I think, you know, there are signs of course, when you're doing this, if you can ask yourself, is there anything that would make me say I'm wrong about this? If the answer is no, okay, I think I'm like caught up in kind of like a religious fervor here. I think I am caught up in like a tribal craze at this moment. And you can also say, you know, do I get kind of irrationally angry when someone disagrees with me on this? When I see something, you know, that tells me, you know, the people who disagree with me, do I hate to them? You know, these are all signs that you are doing that thing that all humans do, right? It does not doesn't mean you're a bad person. It doesn't mean you're a dumb person. Everyone does it, right? And it just means, oh, I've slipped down on the ladder. And just having that thought right there, boom, you're already up a few runs just having that thought. Because when you're really down in the ladder, you don't know you're doing it. You are totally lost in it. And so a little bit of self reflection can go a long way. And then of course, you know, what's the best way to help yourself here is surround yourself with other people that value high rung thinking, even if they don't use that term, they just happen to be there. So there again, as a group, you still will sometimes slip down, but you will find that like it can be like a support group. If you have people that tend to not identify with ideas, where the group itself likes to disagree, right? If the group is always agreeing on everything, I think you're you've fallen into a low rung echo chamber, which is again, collaborative low rung thinking. A high rung group, which I would call an idea lab is kind of the opposite of an echo chamber is just a place where people attack ideas, but not people. It's a place where disagreeing is cool. We're humility. We're saying I don't know makes you seem smart, not wishy washy or dumb, where people change their minds and where people disagree for sport. And argument doesn't mean you're in a fight. And it's yeah. And when you're in an echo chamber, you can see it where it's like, wow, everyone agrees. And we're having way too much fun agreeing and talking about how bad the other people are.

> “I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing.  I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.”

            -Richard Feynman

In this age of infinite knowledge all viewpoints are becoming widespread and commoditized. There are legitimate arguments for anything from fluoride in the water to flat earth. In this treadmill of noise, how do we really take a step back and deduce a well-reasoned position that addresses the big questions posed in the field and weighs them on merits?  Understanding that many generational ideas like evolution or genetics were once thought of as fringe ideas of crazy people. Galileo was accused of heresy for suggesting that the sun, not the earth, was the center of the universe. Galileo was wrong about this scientifically, but in some deeper sense the Church's position was the right one to take.  Our lived experiences put us at the center of our universe and to reject this belief about ourselves was too fundamental in the belief web to seriously address, so they just banished him. This event is an example of the complex calculus that goes into what someone believes as this is not just a truth judgement, but a function of how this new idea fits into the lives of those who listen, and if they are willing to bear the consequences that comes with accepting the premises. These emotional aspects in decision making and changing our beliefs are inherent in human nature. How can we figure out a good framework for thinking that does not bias what we think and gives us a high probability result. The answer to this has roots that date back to the time of Galileo in the Renaissance and has been popularized by many. We will focus on tactics ideas and examples throughout history on a conjectural way for approaching all situations critically and open mindedly.

In Tim Urban's newest book, he juxtaposes the ideas of an idea ladder and spectrum. The spectrum is what you say while the ladder is how you say it. Democrats and republicans are on the opposite sides of the spectrum, but this says nothing of their placement on the ladder. Tim's framework for the ladder spans the range between thinking like a scientist and thinking like a zealot, which boils down to the idea of valuing truth seeking versus being right. The argument here is one of a long vs short term incentive misalignment. Choosing to seek truth now will get you closer to the answer in the future when compared to the blind belief in your ideology, which makes you right in the present moment. The issue with truth seeking is tied to the idea of the fallibility of human knowledge and makes defaulting to being a zealot much easier than truth seeking. Because zealots can always be right in the moment, and we only have the capacity to live in the present, the zealot can never be wrong.  They can resist the truth until their death leading to the mantra of "progress in a field happens one death at a time." As a brave truth seeker, one can only hope to be incrementally less wrong over time and never have full confidence in being right. A truth seeker should have complete confidence in the fact that they are always wrong, the fallibility of their own knowledge, because this is likely closer to the ground truth.

Urban likens the low rungs on the ladder to Disney World because you feel magical being there, but it’s all an inch thick and a completely warped view of the real world.  Disney movies always end happy.  The bad guys get what’s coming to them because they are bad, and the good guys win because they are good.  When you adopt this mindset, you cast your world view as the good side and everyone else as bad.  You expect and deeply believe that you deserve to be right and powerful in this world.  This is compared to the world of the scientist, who is venturing his best guess into the world then ruthlessly testing it.  One side starts out knowing they’re right while the other just wants to prove themselves wrong.

This deep superiority complex is what creates static and dynamic societies.  Static societies as outlined by David Deutsch propagate by their spreading of anti-rational memes that inhibit progress while dynamic societies thrive on intellectual diversity and progress.  Deutsch and Urban both get to the same place with regard to the concept of static vs dynamic societies, but Deutsch advances the conversation by invoking his concept of active optimism.  As opposed to blind optimism or even blind pessimism, active optimism takes a positive view regarding the future and mandates we as humans be the drivers of that positive future.  He first takes a dynamic view of the world and then mandates creativity as the only solution to these problems.  Static societies think the future is more like the past and try to optimize and extrapolate while a dynamic society seeing the current state of the world tries to bend and shape it to its will.  Easter Island vs the early settlers of Brittan provides a good comparison in the thinking of static and dynamic societies.  The people of Easter Island when they faced trouble turned more and more towards religion spending more time cutting down trees and building statues to their gods.  Thinking that would provide them food and prosperity.  The Island naturally has a strong climate and would be more friendly to life than the island of Great Brittan, so why did life succeed in the more unlikely place.  Easter Island saw problems and used the same explanation.  They appealed to the gods and as their situation worsened; they thought they needed to pray harder.  The people of England saw the horrible frigid barren winters and devised different forms of shelter and agriculture along with food preservation to continue to develop as a society.  Static societies like Gollum’s shut down discussion and knowledge growth; they thrive on the status quo and resist the creation of knowledge, but dynamic societies create rational memes that lead to the creation of new knowledge.  One seeks to inhibit critical faculties, the other engage them.

Daniel Kahnamen invokes the idea of turning our mental faculties on and off in different situations through the mental model of system 1 and system 2.  System 1 is our default static state of assuming the world is what it is.  This is the preferred state because accepting things is much easier than trying to think through them.  System 2 is effortful, engaging, and certainly not the default position.  Living in a static society is mentally much easier, but we can miss the gorilla right in front of our faces.  Viewing the world in a static unchanging end of history way or a whitespace primed for idea generation and creation has a massive effect on the trajectory of someone’s life.  Some view the world as a solved problem while others believe it constantly hides secrets for the curious ones to uncover.

> John Dewey - Dewey does not see truth as static like a multiplication table, but evolving and growing. Thought as an evolutionary process instead of thought as final. No absolutes all reality is temporal. Truth is based on the mental models and beliefs in the statements not the words actually said. False belief is when you entertain it you are surprised by the wrong outcome. Makes inquiry the subject of knowledge thinks inquiry leads to unified wholes. Truth is the logical outcome of inquiry. Relations of an organism to environment is not only satisfactory when the organism adjust to make the environment more suitable for it that is inquiry. Divides beliefs into good and bad beliefs and this is judged based on the future effects of the beliefs. If you get new information and change, but still fail, that was not truth but if you make those same changes and succeed, then that is truth, even if it’s acting on the same information. Judge belief by effects not causes. Instrumentalist and power over environment. All philosophy deeply shaped by surrounding environment intoxication of power and not checking your pride can lead to madness we need humility.

Information of a message - The less the recipient knows about what comes next the more information is being revealed. There are often common language patterns the reveal less information or nuanced complicated ones that reveal a lot of information.

If we aim to acquire more knowledge we must aim for less probable hypotheses. High probability usually reveals nothing information theory. We should seek low probability guesses. Science moves from problems to problems not theories to theories we keep taking on harder problems. Science is about finding deeper problems to solve. Objective truth is truth correspondent with the facts. Truth isn’t subjective because others believe it. Truth can be something everyone actually rejects. This allows us to say we search for truth but may not know when we have found it. It’s a guidepost. We can find inconsistencies that show something is false but we can’t know if it’s 100% true. Science isn’t about finding the best theory but continually progressing through mistakes to better explanations. Science is about finding improbable truths that reveal a lot of new knowledge that is unlikely or low probability. As much interesting and relevant truth. Bold conjectures. Verisimilitude is choosing the most true option 2 theories might both be false but one passes more tests than the other so there is relatively more truth and it is a better approximation even if it’s false. Better agreement with the facts newton and Kepler are both wrong but newton passes tests Kepler doesn’t. Probability vs truth likeness.

Transcript:
David Friedberg
Google's announcement is a paper published in Nature that follows a preprint they actually put out in August. So this news has been out for a little bit. There's obviously a press cycle this week around it to kind of make a big thing about it. But it is a very kind of important milestone in the evolution of quantum computing. So do you want me to kind of talk about quantum computing again? I think we've talked about this in the past. I mean, maybe a brief primer for people, but like, what does this mean?

Chamath Palihapitiya
Practically, I think what people want to know is when did these things actually have an impact in the way, say, NVIDIA's GPUs have had?

David Friedberg
Yeah, the big breakthrough here is that the whole basis of a quantum is called a qubit or a quantum bit. It's radically different than a bit, a binary digit, which we use in traditional digital computing, which is a one or a zero. A quantum bit, you can kind of think about it as a wave function. It's sort of a quantum state of a molecule. And if we can contain that quantum state, and get it to interact with other molecules, based on their quantum state, you can start to gather information as an output that can be the result Of what we would call quantum computation. And that sounds complicated. But what it really means is that instead of doing kind of binary where we're adding numbers together or doing kind of other traditional arithmetic, there are really interesting functions You can do with qubits. Qubits can, for example, be entangled. So two of these molecules can actually relate to one another at a distance, they can also interfere with each other. So canceling out the wave function, and then when you read it out, you get a result that is basically a very, very complex problem that is solved through this quantum interpretation. It's really hard to kind of highlight how different this is from traditional computing. So quantum computing creates entirely new opportunities for algorithms that can do really incredible things that really don't even make sense on a traditional computer. They're not possible to kind of resolve on a traditional computer. And sorry, let me just state one thing. The quantum bit needs to hold its state for a period of time in order for a computation to be done. And so the big challenge in quantum computing is how do you build a quantum computer that has multiple qubits that hold their state for a long enough period of time, that they don't make Enough errors that you can actually do a computation with them. So what Google was able to demonstrate here is they created these call it logical qubits. So they put several qubits together. And by putting several qubits together, they were able to kind of have an algorithm that sits on top of it that figures out, hey, this, this group of physical qubits is now one logical Qubit may balance the results of each one of them. So each one of them has some error. And as they put more of these together, what they were able to demonstrate for the first time ever, that the error went down. So when they did a three by three qubit structure, the error was higher than when they went to five by five, and then they went to seven by seven, and the error rate kept going down and down And down. So this is an important milestone, because now it means that they have the technical architecture to build a chip or a computer using multiple qubits that can all kind of interact with Each other, with a low enough fault tolerance or low enough error rate that they can start to do these quantum calculations. This is a big area of opportunity. One of the very interesting areas that a lot of people are talking about is in cryptography. So there's an algorithm by a professor who was at MIT for many years named Shore. It's called Shore's algorithm. And in 1994, 1995, I think, around that time, he basically came up with this idea that you could use a quantum computer to factor numbers almost instantly. And all modern encryption standards, so all of the RSA standards, everything that Bitcoin's blockchain is built on, all of our browsers, all server technology, all computer security Technology is built on algorithms that are based on number factorization. So if you can factor a very large number, a number that's 256 digits long, theoretically, you could break a code. And it's really impossible to do that with traditional computers at the scale that we operate our encryption standards at today. But a quantum computer can do it in seconds or minutes. And that's based on Shor's algorithm. And if you want, there's some great YouTube videos that describe Shor's algorithm and how it works. But it's like, mind blowing when you look at it, it's like, this really like non intuitive, but simple set of steps that when you put them together on a quantum computer, it's like, this Thing can instantly figure out all the factors and then you can break a code. One of the things that this highlights is that in a couple of years, theoretically, if Google continues on this track and now they build a large scale qubit computer, they theoretically Would be in a position to start to run some of these quantum algorithms like Shorts algorithm. And so we're now kind of spitting distance or a couple of years, it's not really clear is it three years, five years, seven years, but a couple of years away from having computers that Theoretically could crack all encryption standards. And there are a set of encryption standards that are called post-quantum encryption. And all of computing and all software is gonna need to move to post-quantum encryption in the next couple of years. So there's like this big kind of push now to like, how do we do that? How do we accelerate it?

Jason Calacanis
I saw Sundar post it. I saw it in my feed. I ended up missing my next meeting because I had to figure out how long will it take for us to crack the encryption standards that we use for Bitcoin. Nick, here's the answer because I was so tilted by this idea. So if you think of Willow as essentially like one stable, logical qubit equivalent in a chip, we need about 4,000 to break RSA 2048. And we need about 8,000 to break SHA-256, which is the underlying encryption framework for Bitcoin. So I think you're right. I think we're in the sort of like- The end game? Two to five year shot clock. No, I mean, think what'll have to happen is some of these chains will need to obviously re-implement something at a pretty foundational level. The weird thing, as Freebrook says, is like the Willow chips error correction gets better the more of these things you start to use together. Now, there are some really big problems inside these chips, like logical interconnects are very complicated. If you put two chips on a board, like the C2C communication is complicated. All this stuff that we haven't figured out how to do, but this is a big deal. I was really like, my God, what's going on here?

Chamath Palihapitiya
Other projects at Google are finally landing. You have Waymo. It's really incredible. And you have this now. I mean, Project Loon might be gone, but I think those projects, we're going to see a couple of them change the world, yeah?

David Friedberg
Just to give you a sense on the numbers, like Google's target for fault tolerance on a quantum chip to make it logically useful is one times

> Even the agonists preferred reductionism to complexity. Maybe this is innate human nature. There was the great one ness of the world and the void. The issue to why science didn’t make progress is that the density of people and quality of experiments was too low so it never reached an activation energy. Critical mass of smart people. Physics is quanta of energy which was an originally simplified model that got adopted. Wave partial duality. Uncertainty principle. Quantum systems don’t have a measurement until measured. It needs an observer. Copenhagen interpretation reduces complexity by just accepting it and moving on. The idea that we need to accept quantum systems are indetermine until measured. Possible explanation is the many worlds hypothesis that atoms exist in many universes and we reduce down to 1 on observation. Instrumentalism is the Copenhagen interpretation that says it works so accept it does and don’t think too much. Consistent histories theory de coherence histories. The quantum event acts as the observer of it so it adopts a classical state. David burm thoery Universe has a deep deterministic underlying quantum potential quantum order that connects everything creating a deterministic world. Universe is an implicit order. Einstein hated interpretations of quantum mechanics that made the world seem probablistic. He thought it was fully deterministic. Hate’s people thought it could be probablistic. We don’t understand quantum physics and experiments have disproven Einsteins deterministic explanation due to the epr eistein podolsky Rosenberg effect being proved correct shows how little we know about quantum physics. Epr effect says super luminal transference of information is impossible because inform needs to travel faster than the speed of light but it exists. When you fire 2 particles that just interacted in exactly opposite spin states and measure one fixing its state the other particle is instantaneous put in the other exact opposite state without anything being exchanged at the speed of light. change one the other changes in the same way but that information would have to travel faster than the speed of light so it seems impossible yet it’s true and proved by experiment. So we’re like wtf how is this true Also quantum physics and general relativity are at odds with each other and they’re the 2 most fundamental theories we have about reality.

**Note:** Many-worlds explanation - wave function doesn't collapse, observer becomes entangled. You become superposition of seeing clockwise AND counterclockwise, but experience only one branch

> **Many Worlds Interpretation**

- The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) suggests that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are realized in separate, non-interacting worlds.
- This interpretation addresses the measurement problem by positing that the wave function doesn't collapse, but rather the observer becomes entangled with the system, splitting into multiple versions experiencing different outcomes.

Mentioned the many worlds interpretation, and it is in fact beautiful, but it's one of your more controversial things you stand behind yeah you've probably gotten a bunch of flack For it i'm a big boy i can take it well can you first explain it and then maybe speak to the flack you may have got sure you know the classic experiment to explain quantum mechanics to people

Sean M. Carroll
Is called the Stern-Gerlach experiment. You're measuring the spin of a particle, okay? And in quantum mechanics, the spin is, you know, it's just a spin. It's the rate at which something is rotating around in a very down-to sense, the difference being is that it's quantized. So for something like a single electron or a single neutron, it's either spinning clockwise or counterclockwise. Those are the only two, let's put it this way, those are the only two measurement outcomes you will ever get. There's no it's spinning faster or slower. It's either spinning one direction or the other. That's it. Two choices, okay? According to the rules of quantum mechanics, I can set up an electron, let's say, in a state where it is neither purely clockwise or counterclockwise, but a superposition of both. And that's not just because we don't know the answer, it's because it truly is both until we measure it. And then when we measure it, we see one or the other. So this is the fundamental mystery of quantum mechanics, is that how we describe the system when we're not looking at it is different from what we see when we look at it. So what we teach our students in the Copenhagen way of thinking is that the act of measuring the spin of the electron causes a radical change in the physical state. It spontaneously collapses from being a superposition of clockwise and counterclockwise to being one or the other. And you can tell me the probability that that happens, but that's all you can tell me. And I can't be very specific about when it happens, what caused it to happen, why it's happening, none of that. That's all called the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. So many worlds just says, look, I just told you a minute ago that there's only one wave function for the whole universe. And that means that you can't take too seriously just describing the electron. You have to include everything else in the universe. In particular, you clearly have to interact with the electron in order to measure it. So whatever is interacting with the electron should be included in the wave function that you're describing. And look, maybe it's just you. Maybe your eyeballs are able to perceive it, but okay, I'm going to include you in the wave function. And if you do that, since you have a very sophisticated listenership, I'll be a little bit more careful than average. What does it mean to measure the spin of the electron? We don't need to go into details, but we want the following thing to be true. If the electron were in a state that was 100% spinning clockwise, then we want the measurement to tell us it was spinning clockwise. We want your brain to go, yes, the electron was spinning clockwise, right? Likewise, if it was 100% counterclockwise, we want to see that, to measure that. The rules of quantum mechanics, the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics, is 100% clear that if you want to measure it clockwise when it's clockwise and measure it counterclockwise When it's counterclockwise, then when it starts out in a superposition, what will happen is that you and the electron will entangle with each other. And by that, I mean that the state of the universe evolves into part saying the electron was spinning clockwise and I saw it clockwise, and part of the state is it's in a superposition With the part that says the electron was spinning counterclockwise, and I saw it counterclockwise. Everyone agrees with this. Entirely uncontroversial, straightforward consequence of the Schrodinger equation. And then Niels Bohr would say, and then part of that wave function disappears, and we're in the other part. And you can't predict which part it will be, only the probability. Hugh Everett, who was a graduate student in the 1950s, was thinking about this, says, I have a better idea. Part of the wave function does not magically disappear. It stays there. The reason why that idea, Everett's idea, that the whole wave function always sticks around and just obeys the Schrodinger equation, was not thought of years before is because naively You look at it and you go, okay, this is predicting that I will be in a superposition, that I will be in a superposition of having seen the electron be clockwise and having seen it be counterclockwise. No experimenter has ever felt like they were in a superposition. You always see an outcome. Okay? Everett's move, which was kind of genius, was to say, the problem is not the Schrodinger equation. The problem is you have misidentified yourself in the Schrodinger equation. You have said, oh, look, there's a person who saw counterclockwise. There's a person who saw clockwise. I should be at that superposition of both. And Everett says, no, no, no, you're not. Because the part of the wave function in which the spin was clockwise, once that exists, it is completely unaffected by the part of the wave function that says the spin was counterclockwise. They are apart from each other. They are uninteracting. They have no influence. What happens in one part has no influence in the other part. So Everett says the simple resolution is to identify yourself as either the one who saw spin clockwise or the one who saw spin counterclockwise. There are now two people. Once you've done that experiment, the Schrodinger equation doesn't have to be messed with. All you have to do is locate yourself correctly in the wave function. That's many worlds. The number of worlds is very, very, very big.

Lex Fridman
Where do those worlds fit? Where do they go? The short answer is the worlds don't exist in space.

Sean M. Carroll
Space exists separately in each world. So, I mean, there's a technical answer to your question, which is Hilbert space, the space of all possible quantum mechanical states. But physically, you know, we want to put these worlds somewhere. That's just a wrong intuition that we have. There is no such thing as the physical spatial location of the worlds, because space is inside the worlds.

Lex Fridman
One of the properties of this interpretation is that you can't travel from one world to the other. That's right. Which kind of makes you feel that they're existing separately.

Sean M. Carroll
They are existing separately and simultaneously.

Lex Fridman
And simultaneously. Without locations in space.

> Quantum physics has taught us granularity indeterminacy and interrelation of world. There is a limit to granularity of the world. Things cannot exist in an infinite states but a finite amount even if that’s unknown. Another part of quantum physics is that it’s unclear. The world is probabilistic not deterministic according to quantum physics. World is indeterminate at a fundamental level. It reduces reality to interaction things aren’t just as they are but relative to other things. Relations ground the world and only exist with regard to other things. Things are built by events. We are a flux of events. It is the description not of things but processes. Dont think of things but processes. We struggle to understand quantum physics maybe because it is so alien to how we view the world it defies our conception of it. Doubt and question is the essence of science but it’s also about understanding our limitations as people and on our knowledge.

> Heisenberg has the idea that electrons don’t always exist they only exist when they interact or collide with things. Electron is a series of quantum leaps. Doesn’t exist otherwise. Dirac went one step further and saying electrons are completely undefined until they interact. It’s not just position which heisberg said but nothing about it exists. To calculate things about the atoms we can only do so probabilistically we cannot do with certainty. We don’t know where the electron will be we only have a range of probability. Dirac equations allow us to understand what values a physical variable may assume or relationism and then we can compute the probability value or variable appears at the next interaction calculation of amplitude of transition then we have 3rd feature which is probability which is indeterminacy. This calculate during an interaction not in between interactions which don’t exist. The quantum physics discovered here anticipates the periodic table. Shows the deep truth of the knowledge. Dirac equations merges fields and particles. Quantum field theory is basis of quantum physics. Particles are quanta of fields like photons are quanta of light. Current understanding has evolved and is called the standard model which incorporates all things we understand except dark matter.

> **Quantum Computing: From Research to Engineering**

- Quantum computing is transitioning from theoretical research to an engineering challenge.
-  A key concept is the difference between physical qubits (noisy building blocks) and logical qubits (created through error correction).
-  The Willow breakthrough demonstrated the creation of a logical qubit from many physical ones.
-  Breaking cryptography requires thousands or more logical qubits combined into a fault-tolerant quantum computer. 
- This shift means scaling and engineering are now the main hurdles, not the fundamental science.

Transcript:
Justin Drake
Yeah, so one basic concept is that there's two types of qubits. There's the physical qubits and the logical qubits. If we want to do rewards are there. Computation that breaks cryptography, we need these more fancy logical qubits. But the building blocks, the bricks that make up the logical qubits are what's called physical qubits. And unfortunately, the physical qubits are extremely noisy. And so we need what's called error correction. So we need to take the noise, remove it so that we're left with pure signal, which is binary digital signal. And I think the very beginning of our conversation basically was with this willow breakthrough where essentially we have for the first time a logical qubit a logical qubit one of them So we're able to take 101 physical qubits put them in a lattice and basically we have this error correction happen and that gives us this meta building block which is the logical qubit And then if we want to go actually break cryptography, we need to put thousands, tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of these logical qubits together to form what's called A scalable fault tolerant quantum computer.

Ryan Sean Adams
Okay, so I'm sort of getting the picture. Of course, you know this, you're an Ethereum researcher, but you know things in ethereum or crypto at large are just like basically research theory type phase and then they become an Engineering challenge it feels like that's kind of what where we're at with quantum computing where we've been in this kind of research theory type phase but now we've hit this threshold Of oh now it's just an engineering and scale problem and like humans are really good at that that's why scott kept going back to like I don't know when it's going to happen.

**Note:** Perfect explanation - there is past and future but intermediate present because speed of light limits information. Everything is relative. Now on earth is 15 minutes later on mars

> Einstein was a man who didn’t listen to authority well and was reading Kant in school instead of actually learning. The idea of special relativity was invented by him which created the idea of space time. There is the past and the future but also the intermediate present because the speed of light can only carry information so fast there is no concept of now. Everything is relative. Now on earth is 15 minutes later on mars or 2mm years later on andromeda. There is no proper present moment just intermediate time relative to the observer. He connects electric and magnetic fields mass and energy and space and time with his equations. Took Einstein 10 years to get from special to general relativity. The concept of space is a newer invention and the ancients couldn’t quite conceptualize this. In Ancient Greek they thought space was alive but non being. Einsteins said we live in a world of particles and fields and the Newtonian concept of space was in the fields. He says space time is curved and influenced by mass. So gravity and fields are dynamic and part of life and get influenced differently in different areas. Clocks go faster or slower at different altitudes. All of Einsteins a crazy predictions that deviated only slightly from newton have proven true. His info was exactly right. Einstein was bad at math and was in a race with hilbert who was great at math to discover this math but his ability to think differently was key to his discovering the theory. It wasn’t the math but his mind that differentiated him. Space is finite but has no boarder because it is curved. The world is a 3 sphere this was asserted by Dante in midevil times in poetry. Different person and way to get to the answer but same answer. His equations predicted the universe was expanding he fought this for years until he gave up and believed his own theory seemed too weird for even him.

**Note:** Technical details - laws of physics same for every observer in same reference frame but speed of light is absolute. Time moves differently, objects grow shorter in direction of movement

> The laws of physics is the same for every person in the same frame of reference but the speed of light is absolute. This means times moves differently to different people. Time is slower in a moving vehicle than standing on the ground. Objects grow shorter in the direction they’re moving. Things can’t happen simultaneously. Things that happen at the same time for one observer may be at different times for another observer. Mass and energy are equivalent and interconvertable e=mc^2. Newtonian physics works at slower speeds but breaks down closer to the speed of light. Space time is curved and gravitational is the effect of this curvature. Einsteins ideas predict certain things that actually happened and were low probability showing it’s a good theory. When a star loses its fuel gravity pulls it in it collapses in on itself then the star explodes as a super nova and a black hole is formed in its wake with a pull so great not even light can achieve an escape velocity to leave it. Big bang theory. Light gets more blue the closer it gets and red the further it gets so red shift means receding. Universe is expanding. Black holes and event horizons could’ve been the beginning of our universe. String theory has been a theory used to unite quantum physics and general relativity but the issue is it doesn’t make predictions or have equations just elegant theory which some people defend as enough but that isn’t science.

> In quantum gravity the idea of a space field and time both disappear. Time doesn’t exist it’s an offshoot of quantum events which happen independently from time. We never measure time itself but the physical variables of time. Time is useful assumption but breakdown at small scales. There are continuous elementary processes that happen outside of time. Things aren’t in time it includes space time. Passage of time is measure of process. Quantum doesn’t tell us the answer just the probability. We need to consider all possible space times too. There is no definite space time in the quantum cloud but a space time where all possibilities exist probabilistically. Quantum space time is the history of a spin network. It’s called a spin foam. To compute the problem of a process must calc the nodes through the spin foam which is spin networks stacked. Boundary of spin foam is spin network. Through this it’s possible to compute likelihood of any event. Spin foam’s is actually the synthesis of Feynman diagrams which is how you diagram interactions of electromagnetic or weak forces and lattice techniques this is used to diagram interactions when forces are strong this uses a continuous physical space where Feynman diagrams look at particles. These are the two techniques in the standard model but they both actually sum over the spin foam of quantum gravity. The world is made of quantum fields. The world is covariant quantum fields.

> Quantum gravity is the issue of our times because general relativity and quantum mechanics are at odds with each other. You cannot locate a particle at a point in time Hiesberg uncertainty principle. Energy makes spaces curve and the more energy the more curvature ie leading to black hole. At very small scales we get quantum space and time which are weird. From our perspective space is smooth but at a Planck length which is so imperceptibly small space is rough like the seas. Best theory he thinks is loop theory not string theory. This theory is similar to faradays lines but we have a discrete number of lines. The key to understanding these lines is understanding the nodes or the points where the lines interact. Lines connecting are called links. Without nodes physical space has no volume. The clarifies the wheeler and Dewitt equation. This creates graphs. Spectrum of volumes is discrete. Space is discrete when we measure area we’re measuring the discrete volume of the nodes which aren’t continuous. There is an essential smallest volume. Each discrete node isn’t a point in space but space itself. Space is a swarm of quanta of gravity. That act upon each other and things manifesting as spin networks. Space is created by interaction of quanta of gravity.

Most significant science done in that time. Then Galileo discovered falling bodies fall at a constantly accelerating rate. Then newton figures out this rate is everywhere in the universe and discovers gravity. Re ignited science. This physics shaped our modern world and for 300 years people thought physics was solved. Then faraday and Maxwell discover electromagnetism and electromagnetic fields. When we push magnets together why do they repel. This isn’t gravity but another force. Newton understood there was something missing in gravity that there must be more laws that govern gravity. Cannot be narrow as suspected. Newton understood his theory had limits but it worked so well for so long no one questioned it until faraday who asked how bodies attracted and repelled at a distance. His asserts the concept of the field. These electro magnetic lines define what light is. Light is just the ripple of these faraday lines picked up by our eyes. He also discovers there are other waves we cannot see. This sets the structure for radio and tv waves. Forms the basis of telecom networks through these equations and ideas.

He says that people need to be cunning not always do what is good. Keep faith when it works but then also be faithless. Convince the people of your faith and use the rules that work for you not necessarily principled. It’s not important to have conventional virtue but important to project you have them. Believed in the balance of power. Balance of powers. Political liberty needs personal virtue. Love of liberty and checks and balances can’t from antiquity and stood to this day. Power comes from a man’s ability to seize it there is no Devine power and popular governments are better than divine ones because they need to consider the people political goods are national independence security and well ordered constitution a constitution doles out power relative to that persons status ie noble people common people fir stability skew toward more people. Means are important it’s stupid to try something you think will fail you must choose means adequate to achievement there are no morals other than the goal and it’s good to study sinners and saints. Just about the science achieving success and it’s about power. The idea of virtue helps cement power. Controlling the narrative is vital.

Proportional representation doesn’t allow clear views and experiments and can lead to tyranny of the minority so while it’s most representative maybe it’s not best or most democratic. Democracy is the majority power of dismissal not rule of the people. Two party system might be better if both parties are good because they allow clearer experimentation vs the proportional representation. The losing party needs to keep the winning party honest and defend and make sure the winners are tolerant of the other ideologies of the losers. Ideologies that are intolerant lose their right to be tolerated. World views shouldn’t be encompassed in parties political parties are too narrow a framing on a world view small affinity parties are bad and so are party politics and outsourced thinking.

Everyone by the light of nature will do what gives him the greatest advantage and him pursuing this will lead to the best ev for society. Men living together without a superior judging them is a state of natures. Locke took old ideas that were too before their time and catalyzed them brought them to the forefront and got credit for creating them. Men are free and equal to do what they want as far as the laws of nature not subordinated to any. Law of nature implies you can’t harm someone else because that violates gods nature and we’re all gods property. Freedom of self determination but can’t fuck with anyone’s shit. Men can defend themselves of thieves but once they get away the government has to deal with it. Property rights are key to government right acts promote the most general good. Locke believed rule wasn’t Devine but a result of a social contract between the people and rulers. Argues against absolute government and for checks and balances between executive and judiciary. Believed in the labor theory of value that people have the right to the property they create. Lockes ideas on checks and balances are played out in the us through the constitution

Some people have positions over power and no real power likewise people in non traditional roles of power have influence because they have the ear of power. When there is a company change there is a values crisis that emerges that needs to get sorted. When there is a power play or values crisis you need to stay in the loop but these are power games and you can get burnt sometimes you need to avoid the 3rd rail other times you need to navigate the power brokers. This is also a good time to grab power. Power is a 3D object with people being closer to the center of power and higher in the org it’s like a cone the most important is at the tip and you can be bottom middle or bottom outside. This is also dynamic so you need to produce and update structures to remain closer to the center constantly.

> **Moneymaker Mentality**

* A 'moneymaker' is someone with the ability and intent to create more value than they capture.
* They prioritize making money over being right and understand the long-term, iterative nature of transactions. Make money in the long term. 
* They possess a knack for finding where value naturally flows, similar to turning on a faucet, rather than forcing outcomes.
* This pragmatic approach, prioritizing working _with_ the market, can be a key differentiator in successful investing.
* The optimal blend of strategic planning ('Harvard nerds') and adaptability ('Chicago improv') contributes to a moneymaker's effectiveness.

Transcript:
Patrick O'Shaughnessy
It's such an important term in our dialogue over the years. Why is that word so incredibly useful?

Graham Duncan
So the term originates, Adam used it at Goldman. Other people at Goldman, I'd heard it from. And it connotes all the cliches, moneymaker. I think what's in there is one way I've ended up defining it is it's the ability and the intent to create more value than you capture. So that would be a kind of abundant version of it. I feel like there are people who are signaling that they're in a repeat iteration game and they're not going to grab every penny on this transaction because they know that there's a sense Of proportion about it somehow. Goldman has that phrase, long-term greedy. It's like, I want to make money, but I'm going to do it with the knowledge that we're going to see each other again. And that sense of I'd rather make money than be right is another core tenant of it, where there are people who seem to me to be in the game in order to experience the satisfaction of being Right. And that's the primary goal. And that works some high percentage of the time, but then it can be disastrous, of course, because your ego and your portfolio can get caught up with that goal instead of just making money.

Patrick O'Shaughnessy
Was there any through line to the mistakes that you made at East Rock? Backing deals, managers, seeds?

Graham Duncan
There's a great story that Tina Fey has about the only thing she learned from Lorne Michaels. Not the only thing. One important thing she learned at Saturday Night Live that she brought to 30 Rock was that you need in the writing room, you need the optimal mix of Harvard nerds and Chicago improv. And I thought that was so profound when applied to investment managers, because I had experienced a lot of both types. And I would say the Chicago improv is pure plasticity, pure flexibility. They will do anything for a laugh to a fault. And the Harvard nerds in her language were planning everything out, very high order, very high stability, but not able to improv as much. Over time, my taste evolved to accommodate more Chicago improv. I was at first attracted to Harvard nerds. Over time, I came to appreciate, Charlie Munger calls it the knack or called it the knack. I remember early on in working with Ted Seides, we were in a meeting with a former Milken credit trader of some sort. And we were sitting in a restaurant in Santa Monica, and he turned it to me at one point, he put his hand on my arm and said, money's like water. All you have to do is learn to turn on the faucet, see? And I thought I was in some sort of David Mamet movie or something, but he's right. There is this Wu way, not forcing it, working with, there's a coach I like who I follow online named Joe Hudson. And he had this line of, where does the water want to flow downhill? Working with, not forcing it, like working with what already wants to happen that I feel like is in there, lack of stuckness. It's like a pragmatism that at the end of the day rules out over other facets of investing.

> Breaking the Habit of Uncontrolled Thinking

Key takeaways:
- One important takeaway is the challenge of breaking the habit of uncontrolled thinking, which can be difficult as it often involves a paradoxical effect of trying to avoid certain thoughts.
- Another takeaway is the importance of guided experiences, states of mind, locations, and activities that can help individuals escape their own minds and achieve a more present-focused reality.
- Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the desire to weaken and mute the sense of self, rather than allowing it to develop and become stronger over time.
- Lastly, the passage highlights the value of accepting and appreciating the world as it is, rather than seeking happiness solely through external circumstances or preconceived notions.

**Note:** Monopoly-authoritarianism flywheel - corporations fund politicians who pass protective policy, solidifying monopolies

> Monopolies Breed Authoritarianism

Summary:
High transaction fees and limited competition in industries like payment processing and health insurance illustrate the consequences of monopolistic practices supported by regulatory systems.

Incumbent corporations collaborate with politicians to maintain their positions of power, creating a cycle where policies protect these entities, which in turn strengthens their monopolies. This leads to increased authoritarianism and a reduction in civil liberties over time, often only curtailed by revolutions.

Anarchism, misrepresented by popular culture, fundamentally advocates for dismantling oppressive power structures, with a focus on peer-to-peer technology and decentralized systems.

Crypto-anarchism represents a methodology for challenging monopolies and promoting decentralization, enabling competition without reliance on traditional governance models.

The push for decentralization democratizes power, disrupts existing monopolistic trends, and protects civil liberties, framing this movement as a form of political protest and rebellion against age-old systematic oppression.

They really should be commoditized, right? Visa charges anywhere between 30 basis points to several percent on making transactions. That's a fee rate that is honestly way too high for the world that we live in today. It doesn't really make any sense. But they stay there. They don't move towards becoming a utility. And this is somewhat intentional. Critical to this pattern, to this life cycle of goods, is that when companies are creating goods, when governments are creating goods, they don't necessarily want these goods to become Utilities. They don't want every good to become a utility, and they want to limit the ability for their good to become, effectively get disrupted as a result of moving further along in this timeline. So for payments, that means working with governments to regulate who has access to payments, requiring KYC, things like that, basically making it impossible for new entrants to come Into the market to disrupt Visa and MasterCard. This is a strategy that you see everywhere. Health insurance in the U.S. Is a really great example of this. Health insurance should be commoditized. It doesn't really make sense that it's not. But in the U.S., it is not a commodity good. It's a product. And you pay for it like a product. It is much more expensive than many, many other parts of the world. And the evidence that it's a product is just you can kind of see the distribution of health insurance providers. This is not what a commodity good looks like. A commodity good is way more fragmented. And that's a good thing. That's how you drive prices down. That's how you actually create competition. There is not competition here. Why isn't there competition? Honestly, because of a broken system. To effectively basically keep themselves in power, usually at the cost of users. There's a flywheel that kind of represents how this happens. You have incumbent corporations will fund politicians. Those politicians will be elected and they'll go and pass policy. And the policy that they pass will protect the donors that funded them. Once they pass that policy, those corporations will solidify their monopolies, grow revenue, and become basically super, super dominant. And then they'll partner back with the governments to give them technology dominance, right? So governments will then leverage the exact same technology, example, Twitter, to control people's opinions, to control the way that they think, and to then fund more politicians And kind of go around in this cycle, where of course, unfortunately, you are the one that's losing. We talk so much about incentives in this space, and that's such a core part of the way that we think about blockchains, about building infrastructure. But there's also a similar kind of system of incentives that exists around governance right now, around policy. And regardless of whether you fall into the economic right or left, the system of incentives, unfortunately, continues to drive us upwards, which is no matter what happens every single Cycle, we get more and more authoritarian, right? Even if you even I mean, we'll see kind of what happens with this presidency. But even when you when you have net reductions in complexity of legal systems, we have not yet seen a net reduction in authoritarianism. We have only seen the slow and gradual reduction in civil liberties over time. And in history, the only instances where that's changed is when you have a revolution. So hopefully we don't have to hit that point. What we do need is ideally something that is not a revolution, but something that pulls us strongly in the other direction towards anarchism. Now, I'm sure the word anarchism makes people a little uncomfy. It makes me a little uncomfy, right? There's a lot of brainwashing around anarchism where, like, the first thing I think of when someone says anarchism is, like, cars on fire, right? Like, that is the first mental image that you have. That's not actually what anarchism is at all. It's just like the association that has been drawn, where you're just like, okay, it's a person in all black that is like throwing a Molotov cocktail. But it's not that. It's this much more simple notion that actually, when you go and talk to anybody, regardless of where they're from, regardless of the political backgrounds, when you go and you talk To anybody about this idea, and you talk about, hey, what do you feel about trying to dismantle some of the problematic systems that kind of govern the world that we live in today? I have yet to meet anybody that's like, no, I think that's a bad idea. And this is what's kind of important, right? It's like anarchism is not this notion of like no rules. It's this notion of no rulers. It's not a end state. It's a methodology. And crypto anarchism is Crypto-anarchism is an extension of that methodology. Now, this isn't exactly the definition, but this is my definition, and it's my talk, so I can give a definition. My definition of crypto-anarchism is this notion of working to dismantle oppressive systems of power and replace them with technology where enforcement can happen peer-to Technology That we now know exists that lets us fix things like the tragedy of the commons, that lets us build these socially scalable systems that have never existed before where no one needs to Police them. Where we don't have Watchmen, right? Where the Watchmen are every person that is running an Ethereum node, which is a completely different paradigm. It's the first time in human history that we've ever had the ability to create these kinds of systems. Where the cost of policing them, the cost of operating them is near zero, and where they're fundamentally untamperable. So if we all share this belief that we can use cryptography, we can use technology, we can use incentives to build these kinds of systems, then that means you are also probably a crypto Anarchist. You should cheer. Yeah, absolutely. Because honestly, when it comes down to it, decentralization is anarchism, right? That's what it means. You're taking away power from a bunch of centralized entities. You're breaking up monopolies. You're breaking up these oppressive systems. That is decentralization. Cryptoanarchism breaks this spiral that we have been locked into. And it does it in this, it's honestly in a way that is effectively political protest, right? Even though we may not think about it that way, even though we are all, to an extent, also working to build like businesses or something that kind of looks like businesses, effectively What we're doing by disrupting these organizations, by kind of resisting against these existing systems, is protest, right? It's a form of rebellion against this cycle that we have been trapped in, really, for all of human history. And the way that this happens

**Note:** Chevron deference reversal - agencies accumulate power over time, create power vacuums with bad incentives

> Insights on the Evolution of Power in Government Structure and the Impact on Regulatory Agencies

Summary:
The landscape of American government with its separation of powers and checks and balances has evolved over the years, with power dynamics shifting between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.

The Chevron deference doctrine previously empowered executive agencies but also raised concerns about unchecked authority. While technocrats in agencies can contribute positively by crafting effective regulations, there is a risk of power-hungry individuals exploiting their positions.

The recent overturn of the Chevron doctrine aims to redistribute power between Congress, the courts, and the executive branch, leading to uncertainty and debates about the balance of authority.

Despite concerns, the ongoing interplay between branches suggests a continual balancing act that ensures essential regulations without allowing complete breakdown.

In the realm of crypto regulations, the Supreme Court ruling may prompt more enforcement actions as an alternative to traditional rule-making. This shift could potentially redefine regulatory approaches and lead to novel enforcement strategies. The crypto industry's experiences may influence broader legal discussions and potentially shape future regulatory frameworks, challenging conventional administrative practices and paving the way for innovative enforcement actions in the short term.

Transcript:
Speaker 3
Okay, I want to try and do my best to kind of like define the landscape that we're all talking about that has been like evolving over the last like 40 years or so. We have this thing in America for all the European and Asian listeners called separation of powers, checks and balances. We have these three wings of government. We have the legislative. That's Congress. They write the laws. We have the executive. That's the president and the agencies that we're talking about. And then we have the judicial. Those are the courts. And they're all in this three -way finger gun battle about who's what power. And with the Chevron deference doctrine in place, a lot of power went to the executive agencies. That's the Gary Gensler's, the SEC's, the EPA's, the FDIC's, the ABCD's, whatever, any sort of agency. And I think the bull case, the good case for this is like we have this fundamental problem in state of like this like kind of like last mile problem of as like we grow in pot like populace As we grow in like technology, like things get really complex. And so we need to have like this, we need to write a bunch of laws to account for all the things that we do. And so what the Chevron doctrine did is it just deferred all that power to these agencies, which was the executive branch. And but then that introduces this like, well, who's checking on the agency problem. And in the in the good case, we have basically like what Ryan said, a bunch of technocrats, like a bunch of nerds. I really want an environmentalist to be like in the EPA. Like that's that makes sense. Some like researcher person to be in the EPA and they'll they'll just write the rules and that'll be good. Let's let's have like the nerds like run agencies. Exactly. Yeah. And like hopefully they write good laws. They'll figure out how to how to manage well. But then the bear case is that every once in a while, you have the guy who takes the position because he wants power, not because he's a technocrat. And that might be a Gary Gensler. Does Gary Gensler want to promote Gary Gensler or does he want to appropriately and effectively govern capital markets? I think that, from my opinion, might be the latter. And so you have these edge cases where you have these agencies that naturally accrue power over time the longer that they live because they effectively just collect power over time. They just say, oh, I think we should govern over that. And they start to select for that, I think. And they start to select for that. And it comes into a cancer. And this is where you get the Arab -Forgis types, which is only small government like some big small government let's go backwards. And so now we have this Chevron doctrine that is overturned and so rather than these federal executive agencies slowly accruing power over time they're going to dissipate power and It's going to be split up to go to the courts and Congress. And now the courts are kind of the people who are like, well, now who's checking the courts? The Supreme Court is now like the people that like no one is checking on. And this is what some people are saying is like bad, like Elizabeth Warren put out a tweet saying like extremist courts are now like writing the rules. But then we're also saying that like now also Congress will have an increased burden to write appropriate laws in the first place. And so we're taking this power that has really accrued in the executive branch and we're kind of splitting it up into both Congress and the courts. And now we're all kind of unsure as to how this whole thing plays out, but that's where we are.

Speaker 1
How's that for the whole summary of all of this? That's pretty damn good. I mean, that's basically it that as with everything else, there's balance. I think a lot of people are both being too triumphal and too pessimistic, depending on how much they hate this case. In thinking that this is like the end state, it's an ongoing finger gun battle, as you point out, between the different branches. And they're all responding to events. They're all responding to different incentives. It never ends. It's always going to go on. If it is the case that this leads to a total breakdown of the government, it's not going to persist very long because the American people will not tolerate a government that literally Can't make sure that the milk you drink is not poison or that we don't have any rules, right? Everybody, I think, agrees that crypto wants some kind of rules. We debate about the nature of them, but nobody wants a total free -for -all, where it's, ah, it doesn't matter. We'll do whatever you want. So I think that is a protector from this being the two downsides of the bear case. But the bull case, the thing I would actually say as well, crypto has experiences where we're special, a proto -loper bright world already. Increasingly, I'm hearing a lot of clever people saying, okay, so the Supreme Court said we can't go after, you know, can't focus on regulations, but doesn't say we can't do enforcement Actions. And maybe this means it's easier to have a court allow novel enforcement actions, even if we can't do regulations. What does this sound like? This is exactly what the SEC has been doing in many ways. They've not been doing rules on crypto for us after all. Instead, they've been doing a whole host of enforcement actions. I think in the short term, you're going to see a lot of people take the Supreme Court literally not seriously, to use the parlance of a recent presidential candidate, I guess, current One. They're going to say that the Supreme Court is speaking literally not seriously. So they're going to try and say, what we can do is we can do enforcement actions now. But in reality, what they're saying is we don't want novel approach to regulatory power at all. But for the short term, for the next few years, it might be the case we see a lot more actions via enforcement actions or trying to comport quasi -regulatory action and enforcement actions On novel spaces. So here too, crypto may be kind of the genesis of a change because we're probably, the industry is going to get through court first in terms of discussing whether or not the current administrative Actions taken by the SEC are actually allowable. And I tend to think they are not under this doctrine we're seeing in Loper Brighton, other anti administrative state cases. If you're saying you can't do this, they're not going to say, oh, but you can do a totally novel off the wall enforcement action. It's not going to fly.

Like gov agencies spending money at the end of the year it doesn’t need to in order to get allocated the same or more next year. The way out of the trap is to revise to rules to work more as intended. The best way to influence the system is by realigning the purpose or goals. Seeking the wrong goal is when you overiptimze for a metric or outcome such that you game the system so that moves when that was only a proxy for the problem and the problem stays unsolved. When a metric becomes a measurement it loses its meaning. If the rules aren’t designed well then the system will produce the wrong output.

Key takeaways:
- Unnecessary accounting and red tape were eliminated, reducing the payroll from 2700 to 1650.
- The speaker suggests that many businesses are overstaffed and lack skilled operators.
- Increasing speed can lead to increased profitability by reducing time and increasing inventory turnover.
- Routing freight over the speaker's own road ensures the best service and convenience.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And he just goes through and does this line by line. All these unnecessary a counting and red tape were thrown out. And the pay rol of the road was reduced from 27 hundred people down to 16 hundred and 50. And he goes on for quite a bit. I'm not going to read all that. I'm just going to give you what was my interpretation of what's taking place. Most businesses are overstaffed. The people running them are just not skilul operators. And so then he's like, ok, well, that you can there's is also way to increase money, is that you can actually reduce time. We are not pouring in greats amount of money. Everything is being done out of the earnings from the railroad. That is our policy. The time of our freight movements have been cut down about two thirds. And so he does that idea, the idea behind what that sens es ar there. He does that a lot. By increasing speed, he actually creates money. And theras very similar apple. Ah, that's one of the best things tim cook did at the very beginning, when when steve jobs came back to apple. And apple actually did this ecause the increased inventory turnover when steve came back ad it was, like, i forgot how much money saved, but it was agood amount. It was like tens of millions. It might even been like 200 millions. Was a good amount of money. Just like making things go faster. We are routing as much as we can around our own business over the road, but only because we we because on this road we get the best service. For years past, we ad been trying to send freight over this road that i now own, that i previously didn't, is what he's telling us, right? Because it was conveniently located. But we'd never been able to use it to any extent because of the delayed deliveries.

> Most of us have a kind of meta-process going on in our head anytime we’re in a trial-and-error mode. At what point do I cut my losses and quit? At what point do I just toss this frustrating broken thing and buy a new one? At what point do I just give up on a plan entirely and choose to forgo something?  The resourceful person rarely asks is this worth it, because by a rarely questioned default, it always is. Resourceful people have extremely stable commitments to extremely stable goals and desires, by default. It’s not specific goals and desires. They’re that way about all goals or desires. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing.  When you consider that as a revealed Weltenschauung, a life-scale worldview and attitude, you could say that the resourceful person is one who has a remarkable level of faith in the idea that of course life is worth living. Unlike the philosopher who has to examine life to make it worth living, for the resourceful person, the answer is clear without any need for self-examination. The fully lived life is not worth examining.  To the resourceful person, if you want something, that’s part of living life, so of course it’s worth relentless trial-and-error to get. To want at all is to want life. There is an endearing sort of infinite-game firmware loop deep down somewhere. The point of the resourceful life is to continue playing. To continue wanting.  In a curious way, the superpower of the resourceful person is simply the ability to care deeply and unquestioningly about their own life.

He worked harder than anyone at the whole school. There is no speed limit and the standard pace is for chumps. He goes to film school in the 60s and at this time is the prime of movie making. Francis scorsese Spielberg and Lucas are all coming to prominence and all friends and product of these film schools. The cross pollination of ideas was massive at this time. Copolla set the tone as previously directors needed decades of experience he directed in his 20s. He had hutzpah and was incredibly resourceful he had the ucla film staff wrapped around his fingers in weeks. For a student film he needed the statue of David he found one at a cemetery that banned movies but said he was a college kid and it was an Indy movie he then contacted the biggest camera manufacturer and gave the same spiel he showed up to the shoot with 60 people he had incredible charisma

> Smaller Teams Must Outthink Larger Companies

Key takeaways:
- Smaller teams must be more clever and resourceful than larger ones
- Outthinking the competition is crucial for smaller companies
- Being proactive and offensive in strategy is important
- Being aware of innovative ideas and strategies in the market
- The aid of art, or creative thinking, can help in outsmarting the competition

Transcript:
Speaker 1
So a small team, right? You don't want to go up against an army that has bigger numbers. And if you do, you can't do so without the aid of art. The way I think about what he's saying here is that smaller teams, smaller companies must be more clever and resourceful than larger ones. They just have to. You have to outthink them. One of the books I think was the Everything story. I read on Jeff Bezos. And at the time, Zappos is just selling shoes online but they're making a lot of progress against them. This is before Amazon buys them. And there's a great story in the book about this meeting that they're having inside of Amazon because Bezos realized that when they started making, like after all the terrorist attacks, They started making Americans take off their shoes and everything and put them at the airport. And that Zappos realized, oh, you're taking off your shoes, you're putting them in this like, you know, plastic bin. Can we see if we can buy advertising on that plastic bin? And Bezos saw that. I thought it was a great idea. And he was like pretty pissed off about it. He's like, they're out thinking us. And so Napoleon is you need the aid of art. When you occupy a position which the enemy threatens to surround, you should collect your forces quickly and menace him with an offensive movement. Default offense is the way I think about a lot of what Napoleon writes about. I love this quote. Nolan Bush knows the founder of Atari and Steve Jobs' mentor.

- For one-way doors, speed is the most important metric for making a decision.

Transcript:
Speaker 2
Actually, it's interesting you mentioned that you said that there's no points for degree of difficulty. One of the things that I've been playing around with in my head lately is that most of the people that I think of as exceptional decision makers, consistently good decisions, find themselves in consistently good positions. And when you're in a consistently good position, all of your options basically are good. You're never forced into a bad decision. And when you're in a bad position, there's like one Hail Mary that might get you out, but everything else is just gonna go from bad to worse.

Speaker 1
I think that it is generally true. And my, look, I mean, you have a lot more experience, actually, than I do in thinking through this and talking to people. So the reason that I find myself largely agreeing is I think the really good decision maker is what they do is they're very good at identifying the one way doors versus the two way doors, right? And on the one way doors, their metric is speed. And they're sort of like, I need the feedback as soon as possible, on the two way doors, their feedback mechanism is just like, I gotta optimize for speed. I gotta make this one quickly. I don't care if it's wrong, if it's wrong, we'll fix it. One of my big things is you can bounce back from any mistake other than a mistake of integrity. If you don't make a mistake of integrity, you can really actually just like fix almost anything, right? And then I think those same decision makers on the one way doors, they're super thoughtful and they get them right.

> Making Significant Decisions in Business and Life

Summary:
Every day, I think we all make a lot of decisions. They are kind of low impact. A lot of them reversible. It doesn't really matter that much. The path I got all of us here comes down to probably five or 10 decisions you made in your life. Preparing yourself for those maybe three important decisions is important.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Yeah, this is a really fun topic. I was chatting with a few founder friends recently. We were discussing what are decisions that you made in your company that actually made a difference. In the sense that every day, I think we all make a lot of decisions. But to be honest, a lot of decisions are kind of low impact. They are a lot of them reversible. It doesn't really matter that much. I think the consensus we got to was every year, there's probably maybe three decisions that are actually important that you do to bake. The problem is you don't really know what those three are beforehand, but in retrospect, it generally is obvious. And I think maybe it's where to analogy, but I think in life, it's also similar to in life, you make a lot of decisions about do you have ice cream today or not, for example, but probably that doesn't matter that much. Probably the path I got all of us here comes down to probably five or 10 decisions you made in your life. And so I think preparing yourself for those maybe three important decisions is important. I think being very close to the business, so you understand at a very granular level what is going on. So you have a very firm grasp on reality. So you can increase the probability of making the right decision is also very important.

> **Understanding Stress and Anxiety**

* Stress arises from conflicting desires; resolve them by choosing one, accepting the loss of the other, or deferring the decision.
* Anxiety is pervasive, resulting from many unresolved stressors; address it by identifying and resolving underlying issues through introspection.
* Were gonna die and can’t take anything with us so we need to relax and be happy. Understand the end of our life giving us meaning.
* Wasted time is when you’re not present and doing what you want to your capacity and abilities. Be very present that’s life that’s all there is.
* Observe and rewrite thoughts. Live on your own terms your authentic life. Trust your gut.
* We can change ourselves but not others.

Transcript:
Naval Ravikant
So anxiety and stress are interesting. They're very related. Stress is when, like if you look at an iron beam, when an iron beam is under stress, it's because it's being bent in two different directions at the same time. So when your mind is under stress, it's because it has two conflicting desires at once. So for example, you know, you want to be liked, but you want to do something selfish and you can't reconcile the two. And so you are under stress. You want to do something for somebody else. You want to do something for yourself, right? These are examples. You don't want to go to work, but you want to make money. So you're under stress, right? So you have two conflicting desires. And I think one of the ways to get through stress is to acknowledge that, oh, I actually have two conflicting desires and either I need to resolve it. I need to pick one and then be okay losing the other, or I will decide later. But at least just being aware of why your stress can help alleviate a lot of stress. And then anxiety, I think, is sort of this pervasive, unidentifiable stress where you're just kind of stressed out all the time and you're not even sure why. And you can't even identify the underlying problem. And reason for that is because you you have so many uh unresolved problems unresolved stress points that are piled up in your life that you can no longer identify what the problems are And there's this mountain of garbage in your mind and it's a little bit of it poking out the top like an iceberg and that's anxiety but underneath there's a lot of unresolved things and So you just need to kind of go through very carefully every time you're anxious like okay why am i anxious this time i don't know why oh well let me sit here and just think about it let me write Down what the possible causes could be let me meditate on it let me journal let me talk to a therapist let me talk to my friends let me just kind of see like when does that stress go away if You can kind of identify and unravel and resolve these issues, then I think that helps get rid of anxiety. A lot of the anxiety is piled up because we move through life too quickly, not observing our own reactions to things. We don't resolve them. So this goes counter to what I was saying earlier about not reflecting too much on things. But you reflect on the problems to observe them and solve them. You don't reflect on them to feel better about yourself. To indulge them. Well, if you're doing it to just feel better about yourself, that could be strengthening your personality and your ego and could be creating a more fragile personality. You know, one big anxiety resolver for me is just ruminating on death. I think that's a good one. You're going to die. It's all going to zero. You cannot take anything with you. And I know this is trite. And I know that we don't spend enough time thinking about the big questions. We kind of give up on them when we're very, very young. You know, a little child might ask the big questions like, why are we here? What's the meaning of life? What is this all about? You know, is there Santa Claus? Is there God? But then as adults, we're taught not to think about these things. We've given up on them. But I think the big questions are the big questions for good reasons. And if you can keep the idea in front of you at all times that you're going to die and that everything goes literally to zero, what's there to stress about?

Chris Williamson
Yeah, for better or worse, life is very short. How should people deal with its briefness? Enjoy it.

Naval Ravikant
Make the best of it. You know, it's even briefer than that. Each moment just disappears. It's gone. There's only a present moment and it's gone instantly. So if you're not there for it, if you're stressed out or you're anxious or you're thinking about something else, you missed it.

**Type:** counterpoint  

**Note:** Hindsight bias shows how outcomes change our reference points for judging past decisions - limitation of mental accounting

> To think clearly about the future we need to clean up our thoughts on the past. We can’t know what going to happen only have some idea because the future is unknown so nothing can be known about it we have to do the best we can with what we have. We do have incredible hindsight bias in outcomes. Tough to know the unknowable and it’s more clear in hindsight. People think they thought something different in the past based on how the future turned out they change their past beliefs. Outcome bias makes it hard to understand beliefs when the decision was made. Hindsight is unkind with people who act for agents for others. The worse the outcome the greater the hindsight bias. We think we know more in the moment then we actually do. Tough to understand skill vs luck in a situation that is rare and a few lucky outcomes in big situations can lead to skill being overrated for that person

**Note:** Product positioning shows how category reference points shape customer assumptions and perceptions of value

> Positioning Shapes Perception

Summary:
The positioning of a product within a specific market category significantly influences customer perceptions and assumptions.

By labeling a product as CRM, for instance, potential customers automatically associate it with familiar competitors, such as Salesforce, and infer characteristics such as target audience, pricing, and functionality. Effective positioning can streamline marketing and sales efforts by aligning customer assumptions with the product's true value.

Conversely, poor positioning can create misunderstandings, necessitating additional clarification and effort from sales and marketing teams to correct misperceptions.

Therefore, strategic category positioning is crucial for a product's success.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
I'm just going to talk about the market category. So the category that the product is positioned in. So I walk out and I say I've got this amazing thing. It's revolutionary next generation thing but it's CRM, customer relationship management. If you're tech paypal and you know what a CRM is, you will make a whole bunch of assumptions about that product just because I called it a CRM. So you'll say, well, you must compete with Salesforce. They're the absolute leader in that market, the girl in that market. So I will just assume that you compete there. I will make assumptions about what that product does. I will assume that it tracks deals across a pipeline. I will assume who the buyer of that is. I'll assume it's the head of sales, vice president of sales. I'll even make an assumption about the pricing, even though I said nothing about what that thing is or who the expected customers are of that thing. But if you assume that Salesforce is my big competitor, because they're the absolute leader in that space, I'm not charging more for my CRM than Salesforce is. So this is how this works. What it does is I position that product in a market category. That market category has set off a set of assumptions in the customer's mind about that product. If I do this well, it sets off a set of assumptions about that product that are true and that's great. Now I've saved marketing and sales a whole lot of time energy effort. I don't have to tell you exactly who my competitors are. It's assumed I don't have to list every single feature. A lot of that stuff is considered table stakes in the category. But it works the same way if I do a terrible job of it. So if I do a terrible job of it, I position my product in a market category such that it sets off a set of assumptions about my product that are not true. Now marketing and sales has their work cut out for them on doing this damage that your positioning has already done where they're like, no, no, no, we don't do that. No, no, no. I know you think that. No, no, no. It's not that. It's this other thing.

> 3. Social Proof we…use the actions of others to decide on proper behavior for ourselves.  Ever wonder why TV shows use laugh tracks. It’s so you know when to laugh. We’ll let you sit on that one for a minute.  People will likely say yes when they see others doing it, too. This is amplified in situations of uncertainty, where we look to others for cues on what we should do. This can be dangerous.  In an emergency, you might look around for clues on what to do and how to act. Others, of course, might do the same thing. This is why, when you take emergency training, one of the first things you learn is how to give explicit instructions to people by pointing at them. For example, pointing at someone and saying ‘you call 911’. Then, you point to another person and ask them to do something else.  Cialdini writes:  In the process of examining the reactions of other people to resolve our uncertainty, however, we are likely to overlook a subtle but important fact. Those people are probably examining the social evidence, too.

Key takeaways:
- There was a parallel market called graphics that allowed pixels on a screen to be computed independently and output in parallel
- Nvidia's technology originally developed for graphics opened up new applications in AI and crypto
- Three researchers from Toronto initiated a major advancement in AI called the Big Bang moment
- Their work led to the development of algorithms for social media feeds, creating significant value
- Google and Facebook acquired the researchers and others working in the field

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And it's so interesting that there was this first market called graphics that was obviously parallel, where every pixel on a screen is not sequentially dependent on the pixel next To it literally can be computed independently and output to the screen. So you have however many tens of thousands or now hundreds of thousands of pixels on a screen that can all actually be done in parallel. And little did Nvidia realize, of course, that AI and crypto and all this other linear algebra, matrix math based things that turned into accelerated computing, pulling things off The CPU and putting them on GPU and other parallel processors was an entire new frontier of other applications that could use the very same technology they had pioneered for graphics. Yeah, it was pretty useful stuff.

Speaker 2
And this Alex Knapp moment and these three researchers from Toronto kicked off, you know, Jensen calls it, and he's absolutely right, the Big Bang moment for AI.

Speaker 1
So David, the last time we told this story in full, we talked about this team from Toronto, we did not follow what this team of three went on to do afterwards.

Speaker 2
Yeah, so basically what we said was it turned out that a natural consequence of what these guys were doing was, oh, actually you can use this to surface the next post in a social media feed, Unlike an Instagram feed or the YouTube feed or something like that. And that unlocked billions and billions of value. And those guys and everybody else working in the field, they all got scooped up by Google and Facebook.

They also go decisions quickly from the government and had a high degree of trust cut through bureaucracy. The Lincoln project was a massive step in both the history of computers and programming with many massive innovations made in the construction. Also they had to find programmers which wasn’t to say that only math types could program because of it’s artistic and Well as detail oriented demands almost anyone could be a good programmer as in any background.

* Cultural background significantly influences individual choices, even in areas like innovation and economic behavior.

* Cultural diversity fuels innovation, as demonstrated by the impact of immigration on US patents between 1850 and 1940.
* Integrating individuals from culturally distant societies takes time, especially if they come from low-trust backgrounds.
* Despite the assimilation process, culturally diverse perspectives enhance creative thinking and problem-solving. Value patience reciprocity and altruism. This is why the western mindset has performed so well.

Transcript:
Joseph Henrich
Yeah, he doesn't actually fit any cultural evolutionary models. And if you include that people are learning from parents and learning from their social milieu, your parents determine where you are in the social milieu. So you're surrounded by people who are being more patient and behaving in certain economic ways. And that's going to have a huge effect. I just told you about how if you grow up in Silicon Valley, you're going to patent in computers.

Dwarkesh Patel
It's not because you have genes for computers. Yeah. Given the persistence of these cultural effects, how should that change how we think about whether it makes sense to have more immigration from societies that are already weird or Whether that matters or not. Right.

Joseph Henrich
So we have a paper under review right now in which we show that from 1850 roughly to 1940, a big driver of U.S. Innovation, both the quality and quantity of patents, is the cultural diversity of counties. And we actually use immigration as a kind of way of showing the causal effect of this. So what you want is a lot of cultural variation. Now, if you get people from societies that are more distant from whatever the current US culture is at the time, it's going to take more time until they're able to fully integrate. So if they're coming from very distrusting society, they're not going to be able to latch into the collective brain immediately. So you see this in early, in around 1900, there's data from people mostly coming from Southern Italy and coming from Germany and Britain. And the Southern Italians are coming from a society that has a high distrust of strangers. So their immediate effect on the patenting system is low. But the strength of these cultural traits seems to go down by an order of magnitude each generation. So the second generation, you can still see where they came from. But they're a lot more like the majority culture than their parents. And then it goes down another order of magnitude. So, yeah. So you just have to do more work essentially to assimilate people and culturate them. But the potential value of having diverse ways of thinking, different ideas can be really valuable, I think.

Dwarkesh Patel
What do you make of Garrett Jones? So Garrett Jones is an economist who has this, he calls this spaghetti theory of assimilation. I don't know if you've heard of this. The idea is basically like, look, immigrants do assimilate, but they also assimilate us. And so whatever cultural practices they have will, in proportion to their size of the population, have an effect on wherever they migrate to. And his example is like when Italians came to America, spaghetti, which is like traditionally an Italian dish, also became an American dish, right? So they assimilated American culture as well and make, you know, sub in like traits like trust or whatever there. Basically, this like sort of reciprocal assimilation has implications of whether we want immigration from non-weird societies. What do you make of that idea?

Joseph Henrich
So, I mean, I think that the spaghetti example is – or the pizza or spaghetti, both good examples, is a great thing, right? Because, I mean, American food is a fusion of cuisine from lots of societies, and that leads to quite good food. Same thing, you can see music. So things like jazz have African rhythms in them. And so rock and roll, you know, is along that lineage.

Dwarkesh Patel
But we don't want like – do we want the diversity in low trust and high trust?

Joseph Henrich
Well, but the question is do social interactional traits operate the same way as these things? And if you have ethnic enclaves, then you're going to get low trust in those ethnic enclaves. You get things like the mafia, right? So you don't want that. But if you had an immigration policy that distributed people, and in a high-trust society, you benefit by being higher trust because you can do things like collaborate and start companies And stuff, which you have to be high trust to do that. Otherwise, you don't do it in a very effective way. So there is a pressure for low trust people to become more high trust. But if you're in mostly high trust people, there's not an incentive for you to move down. So social interactional traits are different than things like food types.

Dwarkesh Patel
Yeah. In psychology, there's been this problem of the replication crisis where a lot of the main results are hard to re-replicate. And it's not clear how much of this is real science. Have you looked into how many of the results the weird results are based on of the differences in psychology between different populations and so forth? How much of that actually replicates?

Yeah. I mean, my sense is it replicates quite well. So, you know, we published our paper in 2010 and in late 20 aughts, Armin Falk is an economist and a bunch of others, Achenbecker, Ben Anki published a paper where they measured economic Preferences in 80,000 people around the world. And that just showed big variation in things like patience, various kinds of reciprocity, altruism, so the kinds of things we would expect. And then other large-scale projects have similarly shown lots of variation.

> Complexity Beyond Complication

Summary:
Addressing the challenges of human happiness often involves navigating complex problems rather than simply complicated ones.

While issues such as sleep, exercise, and diet can be tackled with structured solutions, emotional and relational dilemmas, akin to the unpredictable behavior of cats, resist straightforward fixes. These complex problems, such as love and fulfillment, involve endless variables that defy engineering-type answers.

Society often attempts to remedy these complexities with simplistic solutions, such as social media for loneliness, which ultimately fall short.

The essence of human experience cannot be replicated like a reliable toaster; instead, it requires deeper engagement and understanding, revealing the inadequacies of easy solutions in the face of life's intricate and profound challenges.

Well, Arthur, I won't even ask if this gentleman is still alive, but if he is, I hope he's listening as I think we all are and I think we all benefit from this. It's a lot to think about. I think this is a harder thing to fix than a lot of the things that I talk about. I'm not sure why because you would think, well, gosh, it must be really hard to take somebody who's sleeping six hours a night in a fragmented way and help them get to eight hours a night Of great sleep or someone who's sitting on the couch all day and get them to exercise or someone who's living on McDonald's and get them eat happy. All of those things are difficult, but they're not as difficult. I think as taking somebody who lives on a hedonic treadmill and getting them to adjust that to decrease wants to make the type of strategic changes that are in keeping with what ultimately Will bring them happiness. I guess my final question for you is, well, first of all, I guess, do you agree with me, but assuming that you would agree that this is very difficult, why do you think it is?

Speaker 1
I've contemplated that enough a lot. I mean, I'll answer that actually in a weird way. When I was doing work for the Rand Corporation on combat modeling using huge computer systems to look at unbelievable number of simulations and contingencies. What I found was that all of the easiest problems to solve, which can be very hard, but they're solvable are what mathematicians call complicated problems. Those are problems that they take a lot of computational horsepower, but once you solve the problem, you can replicate the solution over and over again with great accuracy, like creating A jet engine where every single jet flies and almost none of them ever crash or fail. That's a complicated problem. Now, it took a long time to do that. That's what we call that the toaster problem. It wasn't that long ago that there were no toasters. I recommend that you don't try to build your own. You probably burn your house down, but now you can get a ---0 toaster that lasts you for many, many years, and it makes really great toast. That's a complicated problem, but the bigger problems, the problems that really bedevil us, the problems of human life and the essence of human life are mostly complex problems. Those are the problems where we understand the nature of what winning means very easily, but there's so many inconceivably high number of permutations that they can't be solved. Those are not toaster problems. Those are cat problems. Cats are complex, not complicated. You know what they want, scratches and warmth and kibble and a box to poop in, but you don't know what they're going to do next ever. All of life's really interesting things that make life life. They're complex problems. Love is a complex problem. Love is a cat, not a toaster. The problem that we have in our life today, and the problem with what we're getting from tech, for example, is that they're trying to solve our complex problems of love using complicated Engineering solutions. You're lonely. Here's Facebook. That's like saying, you want a cat? Here's a toaster. So that's the problem, is that these complex issues, they're insoluble, actually. So we're looking for a simulacrum for a solution to these particular problems. And when it comes down to saying, just love more, it's insufficient. And that's why it's so hard. And so what I'll do when I can't get my cat is I'll just try to be contented with a toaster. It's like, I don't know, I can't find a mate. So I guess I'll buy a boat. I guess I'll try to be more successful. I guess I'll try to make more money. And it doesn't work. And that's what leads to a lot of the heartbreak of ordinary life.

Speaker 2
Arthur, I think that's literally one of the most remarkable explanations I've heard for. I mean, certainly I'm familiar with complex and complicated problems, but this application of it is probably one of the most helpful I've heard. So I appreciate that.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
I became my own master, my own employer, and I no longer had to worry about the short-sighted mediocre people blocking my way. You only need to remember one sentence, plan boldly and implement carefully. And then I just want to pull out the ending paragraph of another letter because he just talks about over and over again, the importance of the relationship you have with yourself, the View of yourself, the confidence you have in yourself. My son, your relationship with yourself is the beginning of all relationships. When you believe in yourself and are in harmony with yourself, you are your most faithful partner. Only in this way will you stay indifferent. So what he's talking about is indifferent to the opinions of the external world. I really need to hammer this point home because he's got entire letters, multiple, like multiple letters where the entire letter is about the importance of self-belief. This is one of the letters and really I can give you the main punchline in two sentences. A person's self-esteem is the core of his personality. What kind of person you think you are, you will make you become that person. And then when you read through the letters and you also see this in the autobiographies of Rockefeller, I would say that Rockefeller's internal company, Gospels, that of cooperation. And I think I can, we can just, he explains this in really less than two paragraphs. He says, this is one of the reasons why standard oil is so powerful that it awes its opponents. Sincere cooperation is regarded as the most important factor in our lives, meaning inside the company. Do not forget, he's telling us on why you might want to copy the strategy. Do not forget that everyone is selfish. Everyone is loyal to themselves by nature and that I is the religion in everyone's heart. When we replaces me, the power it gives off will be incalculable. I want to read that and I, you know how it ends. I want to read that paragraph again. Do not forget that everyone is selfish. Everyone is loyal to themselves by nature and I is the religion in everyone's heart. When we replaces me, the power it gives off will be incalculable. Another theme of one letter, which is fascinating, is the importance of patience and really having a high tolerance of pain. He has this great quote where he says, only when you can endure what people cannot, can you then do what people cannot do. And so he's talking about the importance of this practice of patience and self control goes back to that partner that he absolutely hated. Mr.

> Friendship is the Foundation of Lasting Happiness

Summary:
The quality of intimate relationships, especially with a spouse, significantly impacts long-term happiness.

A deep, friendly companionship is essential, as it provides emotional security and connection, particularly during life transitions like an empty nest. It’s critical for partners to maintain common interests beyond their children, as relying solely on them can lead to loneliness and dissatisfaction once the kids grow up.

While many happy individuals find fulfillment in a marriage, those without a partner can still achieve happiness through deep, meaningful friendships.

Real friendships, characterized by mutual support and understanding, are necessary for emotional well-being.

It's important for individuals, particularly men, to cultivate these friendships, as they often struggle to maintain close connections outside of their romantic relationships. The lack of such bonds can lead to isolation and unhappiness, especially during challenging times like loss. Ultimately, pursuing both a strong partnership and genuine friendships forms the foundation of lasting happiness.

You know, recently I posted something on Instagram that I found really depressing, which was a chart of the fraction of time that people spend with others in their life over the course Of their life. So it's kind of like the x-axis is time and the y-axis is percent spent with each entity and it's various curves. And the one that just depressed the hell out of me was time with your kids, which basically corresponds to once they turn 18, it just plummets. Now you've got kids that are, you have three kids, right? Yeah, my three kids have grown up.

Speaker 1
Youngest is 19 in Spain, in college. I know all about how the empty nest works. And there were times, I mean, like I've been in your house and there's a lot of Legos on the ground and there's a lot of chaos that comes from little kids. I remember that in my wife and I, we said, you know, what's it going to be like when actually, you know, they grow up and move out. And it is very different and it's very disconcerting and it's kind of new to us, quite frankly. But the key is, and this is one of the most important things for a happy life, is a partnership with somebody who will be the last person on whom you lay your eyes as you take your dying breath. That's really, really important, a companion love that is your wife. That turns out to be much more indicative of your happiness than actually getting the developing and having a continuing relationship with your kids because your kids are turning Into different people every single year. I mean, that's super fun and that's super interesting. But that's actually not the key. The people who suffer the most from empty nest syndrome is not the empty nest. It's the fact that they're only with one other bird and they don't really like that bird very much. That's the real problem is when it comes in. And that's one of the things that I talk about with my students. And by the way, I'm doing lots of executive teaching these days. And that's what I'm talking about with people. Our age too is the goal of your marriage is not passion. It's friendship. This is the goal. You must be close friends, ideally best friends with your spouse, such that your kids, they grow up and they move away and then you have your grandkids. I'm probably going to have grandkids within my oldest son is married. They're going to have kids quick at bed. I don't know, you can tell them I'm projecting and praying about this. But then I'll have grandkids and it'll be a different experience. But I'm going to be with my wife Esther and Phil left to us part. So that has to be the juice of the relationship or the love that actually makes true happiness and love truly is the great secret to happiness.

Speaker 2
That's the one saving grace is as I feel very fortunate that my wife and I are. We joke that we're the best roommates in the world. I think we'll have a lot to enjoy in that transition. Is the implication of that though Arthur that because I don't think it is, but how do we reconcile then a person who chooses not to have a partner?

Speaker 1
There are some people who do really, really well on their own that you know, introverts who like to live alone for example and loneliness is not the same thing as solitude. Isolation and solitude are very, very different phenomena. By the way, they're neuro cognitively different phenomena. They affect the brain in different ways. So isolation is always bad, but solitude is not as matter of fact, we all need it. We need it in different levels.

Speaker 2
That's point one. That's point two and actually this is based on the harvest. I'm sorry just interrupted for his agar there.

Speaker 1
You can be lonely in a relationship and you can be in solitude and not be lonely. Absolutely. One of the greatest predictors of divorce is partners who are lonely while living together. This gets back to the big danger of the M.T.S. Syndrome is that the only thing you have in common is your kids and that one point of commonality disappears and you're sitting across the table blinking at each other during dinner Not talking because you literally don't even need to talk about that's metastatically awful for a relationship. And so that's why it's critically important that couples have something in common besides their kids that they're practicing their religion together. They're practicing interest together. They're reading the same things. They're on the same philosophical journey together. I mean, one of the things that I talk about with couples is that they should develop philosophical interests and comment. They're talking about deep things. The gold standards that your kids are like, ah, mom and dad are talking about care, care care again or whatever. I mean, it's got to be something that's bigger than digit change is diaper. That's not going to be something you have in common forever and you're going to be lonely inside your relationship. The second big point, however, is that whereas most of the truly happy people as they get older, they do have a spousal partner where that's companion in terms of its love, which also Has some passion, but the companion part is a send it throughout your marriage. Whereas the passion part is not as high as it used to be. And that's completely okay. That's healthy, normal and actually advisable because it's more sustainable over the long run. But some people are very happy and don't have that. What do they have in common? Very, very close personal lifelong friends. So here's the key. If you don't have a spouse, you need real friends. These are people who know your secrets who would take your 2 AM phone call and that you talk to a lot. Now that doesn't mean that if you're married, you don't need that because when I talk to especially men, men are horrible at real friendships, they're the worst. They got lots of deal friends, but no real friends a lot of the time, especially if they're really successful in business. And so we'll say, okay, name 2 guys or whoever who are real friends besides your spouse. And they're like, yeah, so and so and so and so. And I'll say, what was the last thing we talked to him? He's like, I don't know, 4 months ago, not a close friend. That's just the case. And so you got to work on these things for sure for a lot of reasons besides the fact that it's just healthy and good. You also might at some point be left alone if you're widowed and you don't want to be alone in the world in those circumstances. That's really corrosive. That's one of the reasons that men do so poorly when they lose their wives to death. A lot of them don't have real friendships to backfill any of this need and their souls. Why?

Summary:
The speaker reflects on the concept of elders versus the elderly, emphasizing the importance of being outwardly focused rather than self-focused.

Meeting elders who exhibit genuine care and love, regardless of circumstances, shows a life filled with joy, lightness, and freedom. This reflection leads to the realization that life can be lived either out of fear, shame, and hiding, or out of genuine love and care for others and oneself.

The speaker suggests that everything in life revolves around these two ways of living, highlighting the contrast between fear-driven scarcity and a life of love and care.

Right. Exactly. And vice versa, right? If I did buy the meal, it was a little bit like, you start playing with ideas in your head, oh, am I only a checkbook? Do people really like me? And it's like, well, you're the one who insisted on buying dinner. And you're like, well, but the other person could have insisted on buying dinner more, you know? Oh, you start getting into this like weird psychology. You didn't fight back Right. You get the old alligator arms, you know? And so now it's like the inverse of that. And I think this is like a good metaphor for life. Like I think that the more that I meet what I would call elders, so there's a difference between elders and elderly. Elderly are like self -focused in curved, like Blaise would call it, incurvature, right? They're incurred on themselves. They're irritable. Life is all about them and what they need and they're scared and fearful. And you've got elders who are the inverse of this, right? Who are outwardly focused, right? The more I meet these types of elders that are genuinely caring and loving, the more that I see them exhibiting this type of behavior, the more that I see them, like no matter their circumstance, In good circumstances or in bad circumstances, they live with a joy and a lightness and a freedom. And then you see Elder Lee and sort of now I can pull it back and see in my life that like no matter my circumstances, like I'm living in fear shame and hiding. And so it's like I think that's the thing that we're really talking about here is like these are all even like maybe the second teardown or the third teardown like at the basement of all This stuff at the very core of all this stuff is there are really only two ways to live. You're going to live out of fear, or you're going to live out of genuine love and care for others. And love and care for yourself. And like that's it. Like everything else rises between those two. Like, like fear driven is scarce.

> Each country had their own calendar which was far from standard and revolves around religious festivals. The entire life was kept secret by priests who changed days in months to accommodate religious events. The census was created for big festivals where sacrifices were made to cleanse ills. If a stranger was there the ceremony was under threat and if a man did not show he was no longer counted among the pure citizens. They counter and wrote down everyone. These festivals if there was a bad event would be considered an act of the gods and a date where no festivals could be held because the gods weren’t with it that date. Also at these festivals the social standing in the tribe like senator or farmer was fixed. Before battle they would make sacrifices and if they were unfavorable wouldn’t fight. Likewise the religious headwear warn at festivals was also warn in the senate. Religion enveloped all parts of man’s life.

Transcript:
Cal Newport
So first of all, I love the approach you're taking here. This is classic LCP. You have an ideal lifestyle vision in mind, and now you're working backwards from that vision to saying, how can I actually make this possible? So when you're working backwards from a lifestyle vision, the things that matter typically is going to fall into the categories of obstacles and opportunities. What are the obstacles in the way for me getting where I am right now to something closer to that ideal lifestyle? The opportunities are what can I leverage? What type of like unique setup? This could be like career capital or family connection or whatever. What opportunities do I have to leverage as well? So you want to systematically work at reducing or bypassing obstacles while taking advantage of everything that you have, all the opportunities you have as well. So that's probably the right thing to do here. In this analysis is you're seeing the particular types of jobs you have in the animation industry is not remote work friendly. And your lifestyle vision, when you work backwards from it, remote work really makes that work, right? Because if you can be in a lower cost of living place, you could be at home and growing food and be near family and maybe not need to work as many hours because where you're living is less Expensive. If instead of being near Burbank or Disney is, you're instead, you know, where you grew up in Indiana, it's going to be cheaper to live. Like remote work seems to be at the core of it. So there's a key obstacle here if your current job trajectory isn't making that possible. So now you know what you're doing. Oh, I am systematically exploring and looking for insight. It might not be obvious, but I'm looking for a moment of insight about how do I reduce that obstacle? That's probably going to come from leveraging the opportunity of the various skills you have and looking for adjacent applications so like sure maybe if i want to be in like feature Motion picture animation there's like three options they're all based in california and they're cutting back and there's not remote work options but maybe there's an adjacent step Here actually this graphic skills i have could be used maybe not in like feature film uh whatever um animation but it could be used in whatever uh

> A lot of our issues arise in relation to our relationship with others. All problems are interpersonal relationships problems. Envy rules the world. Value is based on social context. We have or create a superiority and inferiority complex. Inferiority can inspire us to do more but likewise can cause a lot of problems and unhappiness when we constantly compare ourselves to others so we need to balance these things. Feeling inferior means you lack something in the present but how do you compensate for what is missing the best way is through striving and growth but you can also develop an inferiority complex. Another way to feel superior is to fabricate it by associating yourself with famous people or clothing this is a superiority complex but at the base is inferiority. Those who boast are insecure. Superiority and inferiority are two sides of the same coin. Talking about the benefits to modern victim culture.

Women had imense power but below the men’s power. Gift giving on a grand scale was vital to weddings. Sacrifices were made and gifts were given even to people not involved in the wedding. Then they went on a 4 week honeymoon where they took the statues of the gods around which were believed to be gods themselves. Visited the shrine of the dead. This was more spiritual than fun. The statues never left the palace so this was a big occasion no one would steal these but they needed security in case someone wanted to hold them hostage.

- Engaging in activities aligned with personal values and strengths on shorter timescales can build toward long-term purpose.

Andrew Huberman
Okay, every moment of it might not be as awesome as you might like, but there's meaning in spending time with people that are extended family, especially when elders and younger are In the same room. It layers on story to create this sort of other level that we call meaning. And so what I'm realizing is these are three timescales. Yeah. So we have the immediate timescale of happiness. We have the kind of intermediate one where we introduce a story and then we have meaning which is kind of like this whole picture yeah so it seems to me that we need to approach happiness From all three levels that it's not enough to just be like a dog yeah which are in the sensory experience presumably of of happiness if they tell stories they don't tell them to us. Yeah. And if they have meaning, I don't know. But they seem to like nail the first level. Yeah. So – and they're probably five more.

Laurie Santos
And they probably don't have the capacity to do the other two. So it's not like they're not doing it and kind of missing out. They kind of have brains that don't let them notice they're missing out. But we unfortunately have brains that would feel like we were really missing out if we just had the sensory experiences, you know, without the good stories. I think you're sort of pointing to this idea that sort of being happy in your life and being happy with your life. The with your life part has the kind of medium timescale stories. But also the really big ones, right? You know, is my life, am I doing anything really meaningful with my life? Am I finding purpose and so on? The funny thing, though, is to get to that big timescale to find a sense of purpose and stuff like that. Sometimes it pays to do stuff at the local level, at the medium and shorter term timescale. And one of the things researchers have found is that if you're engaging in activities at the short term timescales that kind of fit with your values or what these positive psychologists Have often called your strengths, that can be a way to sort of achieve purpose. So what are strengths? So researchers do this thing where they want to look at like all the valuable things people can do out in the world, right? And so what are the things that you value? And folks like Chris Peterson and colleagues have come up with this list of what they call different character strengths. And there are things that like, you know, you can actually, if you Google online character strengths, you'll get the big list. Often people talk about there being 24. But they're just universally good things like being brave, you know, citizenship, humor, like, you know, social intelligence, love of learning, right? You know, kind of empathy, fairness, right? These kind of sets of values that we have. People differ in how much they value

Summary:
The narrative illustrates the impact of historical events on individual life choices, emphasizing that those who grew up during the Great Depression and World War II had to prioritize survival and responsibility over personal aspirations.

This generation came of age amidst hardship, resulting in a mindset that discouraged the pursuit of dreams and passions. Instead, they focused on rebuilding society and fulfilling familial and societal duties, which shaped their identities and values.

So I want to give you a little background there too, because I think it will enhance your understanding of the story. My father had grown up during the Great Depression and when Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese in 1941, he was just 20 years old. He wasted no time joining the military and marrying my mom. His generation had to grow up fast. They had no time to indulge youthful dreams or ponder the meaning of life. They had to rebuild a country devastated by the depression and war. He had not, my father had not followed his own passions in life. That simply wasn't what people did in that era.

**Note:** Deep insight into how local knowledge (metis) often appears messy but contains practical wisdom that formal analysis misses

> Local knowledge like craftsmanship requires a feeling that can’t be codified like a fire fighter or pilot you need to understand rules of thumb then apply them practically. You wouldn’t want someone to guide you up a mountain to have gone up other mountains not this one. You’d rather have the local tracker knowledge. Métis = local knowledge all knowledge is situational or ambiguity. Socrates believed Métis was in the conversations of the Socratic method that philosophy was in the conversations not the words. Practical knowledge weighs more that it works then how it works. Scientific knowledge is based on experiment and not this local knowledge the issue is some things can’t be fully quantified or are better learned through formal truths. The issue with this thinking is that it views everything as not solved through science as wrong when in reality it’s just another method or direction. Discover what works less contented with why it works vs science needs to know why and what isn’t a guiding principle. Going toward a world of bounded rationality and satisfying instead of a world of facts and data. The quest for global universally applicable truth being left in the stead of local knowledge. No science will prove the best way to climb a mountain all the time with 100% certainty you need nuance and exploration of uncertain. Sometimes it rains and you want to avoid areas that might be faster in the dry weather but lead to more risk of falling sometimes it’s hot and you want shade. Long nuance short determinism

> Gardner reveals knowledge of truth outside of natural science that can only be understood through understanding. Hermeneutical method we can’t understand history and art through science but through language and lived being do we understand truth. Truth is an event something we encounter. We present ourself to being part of a situation but we are not the entire thing give up effort of control giving up motivation of winning to focus on just playing the game itself. Play absorbs the subject when we’re interpreting a situation and truth through winning comes through the total immersion in the subject and playing in the game. Were taken out of ourself into something larger. Truth comes when art speaks through play to tell you something not theoretical but practical and exestential in your life. We are biased by our prejudices some good some bad. We must just understand and analyze prejudice. Understanding is a historical process. When you can understand something in the system of your biases. Horizon or limit of knowledge like a frame around a picture that helps you see it properly when you merge your horizon with another you broaden your horizons not seeing what’s infront of you worse but better in a deeper more wholistic concept.

> Unlocking Secrets in Complex Adaptive Systems

Summary:
Complex adaptive systems operate in a way where understanding the direct cause and effect relationships becomes challenging due to the high complexity and combinatorial nature of the system.

In such systems, entities have intricate relationships that are not always visible on the surface. Renaissance Technologies (RENTec) has managed to navigate through this complexity by utilizing sophisticated models that have a slight edge in predicting outcomes in the market.

While the models may lack a complete understanding of the market dynamics, their ability to make profitable predictions based on relationships between entities sets them apart.

RENTec's approach involves deriving investment ideas directly from data and signal processing rather than through human intuition, enabling them to trade on profitable relationships that may not be apparent to others.

By identifying and capitalizing on non-intuitive relationships between multiple factors, RENTec has been able to maintain a competitive edge in the market, unlike most other quant firms that rely on human interpretation to guide trades. This data-driven strategy allows RENTec to exploit hidden connections between seemingly unrelated entities, leading to profitable trading strategies even when the reasons behind these relationships are not fully understood.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
It's so funny. It's a whole bunch of people who are in the investment business, none of which are investors. Yes. Another one that you can decide if this fits or not, I was thinking a lot about complex adaptive systems. It's always been on my mind since we have the NZS Capital guys on a few years ago and read their work and the SINFA Institute's work on this. In a complex adaptive system, it's really difficult to actually understand how one thing affects everything else because the idea is the relationships are so combinatorially complex That you can't deterministically nail down this one thing is the cause of that other thing. It's the butterfly flapping its wings. But there are relationships between entities that you can't understand or see on the surface. Do you remember way back when we did our second Nvidia episode? I opened with the idea that when I was a kid, I always used to look at fire and think like, if you actually knew the composition of the atoms in the wood and you actually knew the way the wind Was blowing and you actually knew that all the... Could you actually model the fire? And when I was a kid, and you always just assume no, but actually the answer is yes. This is a known thing of what will happen when you light this log on fire for the next three hours and can you see exactly the flames? I think RENTEC has basically... They haven't figured that out for the market. They can't predict the future, but if they have a 50.01% chance of being correct, then they can sort of take a complex adaptive system and say, we don't really care that as a complex adaptive System. Our models understand enough about the relationships between all these entities that we're just going to run the simulation a bunch of times and we're going to be profitable enough From all the little pennies that we're collecting on all the little coin flips where we have a slight edge over and over and over and over again that they're sort of the closest in the world To being able to actually predict how the complex adaptive system of the market will work. Now, I don't think they can back out to it. No person could explain it, but I think their computers can.

Speaker 2
Yes, and I think when I've heard people from RENTEC talk about this, they will all say, the model does not actually understand the market, but it can predict and we can be so confident In its predictions about what the market will do that we rely on it, whether it understands or doesn't understand, doesn't actually matter. It can't tell you why, but that's okay.

Speaker 1
But it does know it has a slight edge, and so it should trade on it even though it can't explain why. Yes. Well, speaking of models, I've been trying to nail down an answer to this question. Do you think RENTEC was the birthplace of machine learning?

Speaker 2
This is such a tough answer to tell. We actually emailed some friends who are very prominent AI researchers and AI historians and sort of asked this question and the answer we got back is unsurprising. They said, we don't know because they don't share anything. Right.

Speaker 1
It's like the principle certainly came out of the same math community that spawned machine learning, but is what RENTEC has figured out over the last couple decades in Google's Gemini Model and in Chachib—no, it's not because they don't contribute any research back. It may be the case that actually RENTEC has beat everyone else to the punch, and they have a strong AI or something that is actually much more sophisticated than all the AI we have out in The world today, and they've just chosen that they'd rather keep it locked up and captive and make a bunch of money. I mean, it could just be the case that RENTEC is just taking in as much unstructured data as it possibly can, and they were just a decade or two ahead of everyone else and realizing that You can have unstructured, unlabeled data, and if you have enough of it, you can make it, in the case of an LLM, say things that sound right or sound true, or in the case of these trades, Be right more than 50% of the time. Right.

Speaker 2
Make trades that sound right.

Speaker 1
Right. They figured out this big unsupervised learning thing before anybody else all the way up until last year when the AI moment happened.

Speaker 2
If that were the case, we should have a very different answer to powers.

Speaker 1
To illustrate this point, it's quite interesting. Peter Brown's academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton.

Speaker 2
Yes. Oh, I'm so glad we brought this up. Yeah. It was the exact same stew and the exact same cohort of people and social group and academic groups that RENTEC came out of, that AI came out of.

Speaker 1
The other person, just for people who are like, why are you saying that? To make it super explicit, the other person whose academic advisor was Jeffrey Hinton is Ilya Sotskiever, who is the co-founder of OpenAI. I mean, many years later, but still. Yeah.

Speaker 2
I mean, it's like we were talking about with Markov models and hidden Markov models. That is the foundation of RENTEC. That is one of the foundations of AI and generative AI today.

Speaker 1
Okay. Another big one is this concept that you should trade on a secret that others are not trading on. So on the face of it, it seems obvious. Of course, I should come up with some strategy to trade on that other people aren't trading on. But I said a couple of words there, which is, of course, I should come up with and therein lies the fallacy. I think most investment firms try to get their ideas out of people and then do an incredibly rigorous amount of data analysis to figure out if they should put those trades on or not. I could be wrong, but I do not think modern RENTEC does that. I think all of their investment ideas come from data and come from signal processing. And so therefore, you are going to put trades on that make no intuitive sense. And so when you're putting trades on that are profitable and make no intuitive sense, you aren't going to have competitors. If you find a relationship between two things that a human could never come up with or dream of those relationships, and we're saying two, it end things, 10 things, 20 things, 100 things, And in various different weights at various different timescales, that is a killer recipe to exploit a secret that no one else knows and be able to beat other people in the market.

Speaker 2
Such a good point. And many, if not most of the other quant firms are not doing that, some of them may be, but I think most of them are the model is suggesting things, and there is a person or persons who are The master portfolio allocators that pull the trigger or don't pull the trigger. Yes.

Speaker 1
And to be super illustrative, because I think their n...

This is why central planning is tough. Delays are critical relative to stocks and flows. Too short cause over reaction too long cause intense oscillation and destruction. Delays are not often easily changeable you can’t just speed up building time 100x or the pace of discovery. Things can only change so fast before they break even with rapid pace of innovation.

Here he is able to reject a lot of bad wordsmithing that pretends to be logic but goes do far. Rejects bad language for bad philosophy and there is a lot of elequence that hides bad philosophy and bad philosophy hiding in bad logic. Don’t focus on methods or dogmas of a school but pursue interesting problems. Just because a problem is in the classical domain of physics doesn’t mean there isn’t a philosophy behind it. The idea of philosophy is to solve problems and the different disciplines are upshot’s of those original problems and methods to solve them we shouldn’t reject these as not philosophy or become a zealot for their methods as methods are problem specific and evolve and all good problems are philosophically relevant.

They found that getting AI mentoring boosted the performance of the best entrepreneurs by 20% - a very large effect for an educational intervention. Interestingly, low performers actually did worse after getting AI mentoring help because they tended to ask questions that the AI was not good at answering or got advice they could not take (many of the low performers had businesses that were already in trouble). To me, this suggests that AI instruction can have real-world impacts, but we need to carefully design these tools to work for students of all ability levels.

> We surveyed 319 knowledge workers who use GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) at work at least once per week, to model how they enact critical thinking when using GenAI tools, and howGenAI affects their perceived effort of thinking critically. Analysing 936 real-world GenAI tool use examples our participants shared, we find that knowledge workers engage in critical thinking primarily to ensure the quality of their work, e.g. by verifying outputs against external sources. Moreover, while GenAI can improve worker effi- ciency, it can inhibit critical engagement with work and can poten- tially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving. Higher confidence in GenAI’s ability to perform a task is related to less critical thinking effort. When using GenAI tools, the effort invested in critical thinking shifts from information gathering to information verification; from problem-solving to AI response integration; and from task execu- tion to task stewardship. Knowledge workers face new challenges in critical thinking as they incorporate GenAI into their knowledge workflows. To that end, our work suggests that GenAI tools need to be designed to support knowledge workers’ critical thinking by addressing their awareness, motivation, and ability barriers.

The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use these capabilities—generating their own search queries, selecting appropriate tools, and determining what information to retain.

![](https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fd3083d3f40bb2b6f477901cc9a240738d3dd1371-2401x1000.png&w=3840&q=75)

The augmented LLM

We recommend focusing on two key aspects of the implementation: tailoring these capabilities to your specific use case and ensuring they provide an easy, well-documented interface for your LLM. While there are many ways to implement these augmentations, one approach is through our recently released [Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol), which allows developers to integrate with a growing ecosystem of third-party tools with a simple [client implementation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/tutorials/building-a-client#building-mcp-clients).

For the remainder of this post, we'll assume each LLM call has access to these augmented capabilities.

**Note:** Reveals how AI models represent concepts internally and how features causally shape behavior

> Importantly, we can also *manipulate* these features, artificially amplifying or suppressing them to see how Claude's responses change.

For example, amplifying the "Golden Gate Bridge" feature gave Claude an identity crisis even Hitchcock couldn’t have imagined: when asked "what is your physical form?", Claude’s usual kind of answer – "I have no physical form, I am an AI model" – changed to something much odder: "I am the Golden Gate Bridge… my physical form is the iconic bridge itself…". Altering the feature had made Claude effectively obsessed with the bridge, bringing it up in answer to almost any query—even in situations where it wasn’t at all relevant.

We also found a feature that activates when Claude reads a scam email (this presumably supports the model’s ability to recognize such emails and warn you not to respond to them). Normally, if one asks Claude to generate a scam email, it will refuse to do so. But when we ask the same question with the feature artificially activated sufficiently strongly, this overcomes Claude's harmlessness training and it responds by drafting a scam email. Users of our models don’t have the ability to strip safeguards and manipulate models in this way—but in our experiments, it was a clear demonstration of how features can be used to change how a model acts.

The fact that manipulating these features causes corresponding changes to behavior validates that they aren't just correlated with the presence of concepts in input text, but also causally shape the model's behavior. In other words, the features are likely to be a faithful part of how the model internally represents the world, and how it uses these representations in its behavior.

Yeah, we hope. That's right. That's right. Right. I mean, it's good to go to school. Yes. But the goal is so that you can be productive in society later. And so it's good that we train these models. But the goal is to inference them.

Speaker 2
Are you already using chain of reasoning and tools like O1 in your own business to improve your own business?

Speaker 1
Yeah. Our cybersecurity system today can't run without our own agents. We have agents helping design chips. Hopper wouldn't be possible. Blackwell wouldn't be possible. Ruben, don't even think about it. We have digital, we have AI chip designers, AI software engineers, AI verification engineers. And we build them all inside because we have the ability and we rather use the opportunity to explore the technology ourselves.

Speaker 2
When I walked into the building today, somebody came up to me and said, ask Jensen about the culture. It's all about the culture. I look at the business. You know, we talk a lot about fitness and efficiency, flat organizations that can execute quickly, smaller teams. 4 million of revenue per employee, about 2 million of profits or free cash flow per employee. You've built a culture of efficiency that really has unleashed creativity and innovation and ownership and responsibility. You've broken the mold on kind of functional management. Everybody likes to talk about all of your direct reports. Is the leveraging of AI the thing that's going to continue to allow you to be hyper-creative while at the same time being efficient?

Speaker 1
No question. I'm hoping that someday, NVIDIA has 32,000 employees today. Right. And we have 4,000 families in Israel. I hope they're well, thinking of you guys. And I'm hoping that NVIDIA someday will be a 50,000 employee company with 100 million AI assistants. Wow. And they're in every single group. Right. We'll have a whole directory of AIs that are just generally good at doing things. We'll also have our inbox is going to full of directories of AIs that we work with that we know are really, really good specialized at our skill. And so AIs will recruit other AIs to solve problems. Right. AIs will be in Slack channels with each other. And with humans. Right, and with humans. And so we'll just be one large employee base, if you will. Some of them are digital and AI. Some of them are biological. And I'm hoping some of them even megatronics.

Speaker 2
I think from a business perspective, it's something that's greatly misunderstood. You You just described a company that's producing the output of a company with 150,000 people, but you're doing it with 50,000 people. Now, you didn't say I was going to get rid of all my employees. You're still growing the number of employees in the organization, but the output of that organization is going to be dramatically more. This is often misunderstood.

Speaker 1
AI is not – AI will change every job. AI will have a seismic impact on how people think about work. Let's acknowledge that. AI has the potential to do incredible good. It has the potential to do harm. We have to build safe AI. Yes. Let's just make that foundational. Yes. Okay. The part that is overlooked is when companies become more productive using artificial intelligence, it is likely that it manifests itself into either better earnings or better growth Or both. Right. And when that happens, the next email from the CEO is likely not a layoff announcement. Of course. Because you're growing. Yeah. And the reason for that is because we have more ideas than we can explore, and we need people to help us think through it before we automate it. Mm-hmm. That's great. And so the automation part of it, AI can help us do. Obviously, it's going to help us think through it as well. But it's still going to require us to go figure out what problems do I want to solve? There are a trillion things we can go solve. What problems does a company have to go solve? And select those ideas and figure out a way to automate and scale. And so as a result, we're going to hire more people as we become more productive. People forget that. And if you go back in time, obviously we have more ideas today than 200 years ago. That's the reason why GDPs are larger and more people are employed. And even though we're automating like crazy underneath.

Speaker 2
It's such an important point of this period that we're entering. One, almost all human productivity, almost all human prosperity is the byproduct of the automation and the technology of the last 200 years. I mean, you can look at, you know, from Adam Smith and Schumpeter's creative, you know, destruction. You can look at chart of GDP growth per person over the course of the last 200 years. And it's just accelerated. Yeah, right. Which leads me to this question. If you look at the 90s, our productivity growth in the United States was about 2.5% to 3% a year. Okay. And then in the 2000s, it slowed down to about 1.8%. And then the last 10 years has been the slowest productivity growth. So that's the amount of labor and capital, or the amount of output we have for a fixed amount of labor and capital. The slowest we've had on record, actually. And a lot of people have debated the reasoning for this, but if the world is as you just described, and we're going to leverage and manufacture intelligence, then isn't it the case that We're on the verge of a dramatic expansion in terms of human productivity?

Speaker 1
That's our hope. That's our hope. And of course, we live in this world, so we have direct evidence of it. We have direct evidence of it, either as isolated of a case as an individual researcher who is able to, with AI, now explore science at such an extraordinary scale that is unimaginable. That's productivity. Right. 100%. That are so incredible at such a high pace, and the chip complexities and the computer complexities we're building are going up exponentially while the company's employee base is Not. Measure of productivity. Correct. The software that we're developing better and better and better because we're using AI and supercomputers to help us, the number of employees is growing barely linearly. Okay. Okay. Okay.

> Power Shift: Embrace the Alien Intelligence

Summary:
Human error primarily drives most societal issues, yet the rise of AI introduces both opportunities and challenges.

While AI can eliminate human errors, it raises concerns about diminishing human agency as it increasingly dictates decisions across various sectors. The pervasive adoption of AI may redefine concepts of ownership, making human understanding of these decisions increasingly obscure.

This shift is particularly evident in finance, where AI's ability to process data far surpasses human capacity, potentially leading to a system where no human can comprehend its complexities.

As AI becomes interwoven with everyday life, it could replicate the social media engagement algorithms that prioritize content engagement over meaningful interaction.

Additionally, the risk of mass surveillance looms large, reminiscent of totalitarian regimes, amplifying concerns about privacy and control. The emergence of AI introduces a new form of intelligence—alien not in the extraterrestrial sense, but in its fundamentally distinct decision-making processes, posing profound implications for humanity's future.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
Most of them are caused by human error, like a driver drinking alcohol and driving or falling asleep at the wheel. This is something AI won't do. So it has enormous positive potential. It also has enormous negative potential, And this goes back to the issues of power. We are losing power. Every previous technology gave humanity more power. This is the first technology that potentially takes power away from us because it increasingly makes the decisions about us and shapes the world according to its view of the world, Not according to our view of the world. If you think, for instance, about ownership. So AI is not going to be one big computer somewhere. It's going to be millions, maybe billions of agents everywhere. Think about millions of AI bureaucrats in every government office and corporation and university and whatever. And these AI bureaucrats making decisions about us. So what does it mean that I own a house? It means that some AI says that I own the house. How does the AI decide whether I own it or not? I have no idea. Part of the problem with the rise of AI is that, and again, I'm not talking about this Hollywood science fiction scenario of robots shooting people. It's about the AI in the government office or in the corporation that decides who owns what. And it will be increasingly difficult for human beings to understand how the AI decides things because it's inherently an alien intelligence. The acronym AI, it traditionally stood for artificial intelligence, but I think it's better to think about it as alien intelligence, not alien in the sense of coming from outer space. Alien in the sense that it makes decisions and creates idea in a fundamentally different way than the organic brain of human beings. It can process immense amounts of data. It can think on a mathematical level, which is simply impossible for human beings. It's relentless, it's tireless, it never needs to rest or to sleep or to go hang out with friends, if you think about the financial system, for instance. So this is the playground, the ideal playground for AI is finance, because it's a purely informational and mathematical realm. In self-driving vehicles, every year they say next year, and it's still not coming, because it's very difficult for an AI to interact with the massive physical reality of a New York Street. Very difficult. But the New York Stock Exchange, it's perfect for AIs. It's just data, data in, data out. So what happens when AI takes over finance? What happens if, which is happening all around us, what happens if it starts creating financial devices that no human being is capable of understanding, because they are just mathematically Orders of magnitude more complex than the human brain is capable of handling. So, it's not necessarily bad, but it means that we are losing control. We are losing... If today, I don't know, maybe 1% of humanity understands the financial system, and I think this is a huge overstate, overestimate, in 10 years it could be zero. That because of AI, the financial system just becomes so complicated that it doesn't matter how smart you are or whether you went to college or whatever, it's just beyond the human capacity.

Speaker 2
You talk about some of the downstream effects that we've seen in the early stages of these AI agents and making decisions for us. And of course, in the other previous manifestations of information technology like stories and writing, it was all human to human, making the decisions in the network. Now we have another entrant, which is some AI making decisions. And you talk about this idea of social media engagement algorithms being sort of the dress rehearsal for future AI agents. And basically, they are trained to just give you the most engaging piece of content that will capture your eyeballs for just like one more minute, one more minute. And we've sort of seen how that's gone. It's created a lot of fast food style content for us. So we've got that problem as kind of a dress rehearsal. And we also have another problem as we enter this computer digital age, which is mass surveillance.

Speaker 1
Yeah, that's a huge, huge problem.

Speaker 2
You take the Soviet Union in the 1930s and you just extrapolate that forward. Imagine if Stalin had the capabilities of AI agents and all of this digital data and the ability to kind of like monitor you. So there are these two almost attractor basins.

Key takeaways:

- Bowerman emphasized the importance of resting and recovery to his athletes and was admired by Phil Knight, who he never let over train.
- Bowerman's speech to incoming freshmen track athletes emphasized the importance of taking care of one's body for optimal performance.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
But Bill Bowerman, I read his biography back on episode 153. Bill Bowerman is the co-founder of Nike. He's a legendary track coach. Phil Knight, you know, has been on record over and over again saying that there is no Nike without Bill Bowerman. And the interesting thing about Bill Bowerman was, wait, this is decade, people know the importance of resting recovery now, but he was decades ahead of the curve. And so in that biography, back on episode 153, I'm going to read from it real quick, he talks about the fact that he just sees class after class after class of track, track stars, right? And they all make the same mistake and that they don't rest and they get injured and then their career goes to shit. And I just wonder if he had a strong influence, you know, Phil Knight is a very formidable individual. And yet he was able, like he listened to and admired Bowerman. Bowerman never let Phil Knight over train. And so this is the speech that Bowerman would give to the incoming freshmen incoming track athletes every year. Take a primitive organism. Any week pitiful organism, say a freshman, you make it lift or jump or run, and then you let it rest. What happens? A little miracle. It gets a little better. It gets a little stronger, a little faster, a little more enduring. That's all training is stress, recover, improve. You think any damn fool could do it, but you don't. You work too hard and rest too little and you get hurt.

**Note:** Body adapts to variety not repetition - same training for year showed no fitness gains

> Mix Up Your Training Regimen for Better Results

Summary:
The human body adapts best to a variety of training regimens rather than doing the same thing repeatedly.

A study showed that maintaining the same training intensity and duration for a year did not increase fitness levels. To maximize cardiovascular health and fitness, it is recommended to incorporate diverse activities like long sessions lasting over an hour, one high-intensity session per week, moderate-intensity sessions for at least 30 minutes, and one or two days of strength training.

The key is to mix up training routines for optimal health rather than focusing on high-performance training, which requires a different approach.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
That's a good indicator of that higher level of zone two training. So the ideal strategy then is to incorporate all kinds of training. That's what the human body is best at adapting to. It doesn't really adapt very well to doing the same thing over and over and over again. You will not get fitter if you do that. And in fact, in our two year training study, if you read below the lines a little bit, we markedly upscale people. These were completely sedentary. And we worked them very hard for a year, including multiple high intensity sessions, prolonged sessions. But then we said, all right, I want you to sustain that for a year. So we dropped into only one interval session a week and one long session a week. And we didn't increase the dose. We didn't increase the frequency or duration or intensity over that last year. And you know what? You didn't get any fitter. And their hearts didn't get any bigger. The only thing that got bigger was the atria. And we can chat about that when we get to talking about toxicity of exercise training. So the human to come back to our point, the human body doesn't adapt very well to doing the same thing over and over again. And so my prescription for life, if you will, is one that mixes things up. So I suggest to people that you spend do at least one day of a long session that lasts at least an hour. And it should be fun. I don't care what it is. It could be, you know, going square dancing. It could be a long walk with your spouse or a long bike ride. It could be some other class that you take. But it needs to last over an hour and at least to be fun. Second thing you need to do is do one high intensity session a week. I like the four by four. I think it's very effective. There's great data about it from the Norwegians. But I don't care if you did two by six or if you're a Marty Gabal fan, if you did 30 seconds times eight, it doesn't really matter. Just do one thing at high intensity and then do two or three sessions of that moderate intensity at least 30 minutes, getting the talk test and then supplement that with one or two days Of strength training. And what I mean by strength training, it doesn't mean you have to go to the gym and pump iron. It could be Pilates. It could be strength yoga. Anything that requires training of strength and skill in a muscle. And if you do that over your whole life, I think that's the best strategy for preserving cardiovascular health. If you tell me you want to run an iron man, you got to train different than that. And that's a really important thing for your audience to understand. Training for health versus training for performance. Every coach knows how to train for performance. And so if that's your objective, if your goal is to have a competitive performance objective, then you have to train differently. If you tell me your goal is I just want to preserve my health and stay fit and have a good life, then you don't need to train 30 hours a week. But if you want to compete in Kona, you need to train 20 to 30 hours a week or you're not going to be successful. So I think you've got to just clearly identify what your goal of your fitness is and your goal of your overall health.

> The Importance of Atelic Activities and Embracing Mortality

Summary:
Engaging in atelic activities—those pursued for their own sake rather than for a specific goal—highlights the value of experience over instrumental use of time.

Activities like hiking, arts, music, and dance embody the concept of enjoyment inherent to the action itself. Pursuing life strictly through a goal-oriented lens leads to a perpetual postponing of fulfillment and a disconnect from meaningful moments.

This mindset, as illustrated by Keynes' quote, reflects a tendency to live for future experiences rather than fully engaging in the present.

Such avoidance may stem from an unwillingness to confront mortality, prompting individuals to constantly project satisfaction into the future.

The resulting cycle can undermine the richness of enjoyable experiences, as one often finds themselves anticipating the next event rather than appreciating the current one. Accepting the finite nature of time, rather than avoiding it, encourages a more profound engagement with life. A shift from a productivity-driven standpoint to a balanced recognition of mortality allows for a deeper appreciation of moments, even if achieving a complete acceptance of life's transience is unlikely. This perspective underscores the necessity of integrating awareness of mortality into the experience of present activities to cultivate a meaningful existence.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
The idea of an atelic activity, which is coined by a philosopher, Kieran Setia, is this the notion that of an activity that is done for itself alone, not to get somewhere, not to get something Else, that it's not the kind of thing that you will ever have done enough of. And so the example I use in the book, just because it's something I enjoy a lot, is hiking. You can't make hiking any meaningful sense more efficient because you're just, I'm sure you can walk in more efficient ways than others. But the point is simply that the reason that people are drawn to an activity like that is for the experience itself. Sure, there are some ancillary health benefits, absolutely. But you're not trying to get somewhere either in terms of training or in terms of geographically trying to get somewhere, it's just it's done for itself alone. A lot of kind of activities around arts, music, dance can be pursued in a more sort of in a way that culminates in something, but they don't have to be and a lot of the enjoyment people get Is in itself alone. And yeah, I think what Ryan means by stillness is also something that almost by definition can't be an instrumental use of time. And so I think the unifying idea here is that there is something wrong with pursuing a life in which time is considered exclusively instrumentally, so that you're always assessing The value of how you're using your time by where it's leading you and how well it's getting you to that goal. Because of course, at some point, either this has to cash out in a present moment of meaning or you're always postponing. It has the effect of sort of always postponing the moment of truth into the future. And there's a great quote that I use in the book as well from John May now Keynes, the economist, who I think gets at the point of why we do this, why we want to live for future activities, Even though it's a kind of anxious way to live, even though we're never quite at the moment of fulfillment. It's because by projecting our interests in what we're doing constantly into the future, you're sort of securing what Keynes calls a spurious immortality for them. So he's got this quote where he says, the purpose of man does not love his cat, but only the cat's kittens, nor in truth the kittens, but only the kittens kittens, and so on, forward forever To the end of captain, as he puts it. And it's kind of a terrible way to live because you never get to actually love your pet, or plug in there, whatever the other benefit or value of an activity would be. But it has this great advantage on a subconscious level that like it's all because of some way you're getting. And as long as you're still getting somewhere, then you don't have to fully kind of face the pain of the fact that like, no, this is it, that it's not a dress rehearsal, that this is the time You have to use meaningfully if you're going to have a meaningful life. I fall into this trap all the time, you know, of sort of catching myself seeing that I'm really thinking about two days time, when this stuff's out of the way, when this other stuff has Been completed, when I figured out how to do something like then I'll start living in a present way and really getting the value of life. But what we're really doing, I think I agree with Keynes about this is constantly projecting that moment forwards because it kind of feels like you don't have to die.

Speaker 2
Yeah, and I think it's worth saying that again, Oliver, because it's so profound. I think this is the jugular issue. I think it is this connection to our mortality and our finitude that is underpinning all of this difficulty because on the one hand, it just shouldn't be this hard. I sometimes laugh at my struggle with this, where I'll have a number of things over the next month that ostensibly all are enjoyable. Oh, I'm doing this thing with my kids on this day and we're going to go camping on this day and oh, I've got a day set aside to go racing my car on the track. I mean, these are all things that are just pure bliss to me. And when I look back at the month after the fact, I realize every time you were in one of those moments, you were thinking about the next one. It's tragic. And I think this point of am I doing that because subconsciously, I need to do that to avoid confronting the finite nature of time. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's kind of how I'm hearing and processing this.

Speaker 1
Yeah, it makes total sense. And I think, you know, certainly in my experience, but I take solace from the fact that in, I don't think the great philosophers of history found any alternative to this, it's not that We need to aim to leave that mindset behind in favor of a kind of total, perfect reconciliation to mortality. It's just that you shift from this kind of avoidant stance, which triggers so much kind of saps the meaning from life to a stance that kind of looks it in the face and feels kind of sad about It. It's like it's not that you don't want to get tripped up on the idea that you're supposed to become, you know, totally zen about this awful human fate. You can just kind of integrate some extent, only to some extent in my case, but you can sort of integrate that poignancy into the experience. And then you do sort of land, you know, you do sort of fall back into the moment that you're in. It's tricky because I think that those of us in this kind of productivity mindset have spent a lot of time kind of beating ourselves up for not doing enough yet or not getting to a certain Point. And it's very easy to take that same stance towards the challenge of reconciling yourself to it all, right? And then feeling that you're somehow falling short because you don't feel completely zen about mortality. I don't think there's any reason to believe anyone ever does.

> We all have an implicit formula of life that we adopt from our society rarely do we ask the question and develop and explicit philosophy. Takes a big negative point in our lives, to ask questions and think ourselves there’s no reason we can’t do it without that negative experience. Socratic question what sort of person should I be/ values I should aim for. Virtues courage wisdom temperance and justice. There are more questions than answers in philosophy we must create the answers for ourselves. Happiness traditional was seen as a life situation not a passing feeling. Happiness was a good content life. Time is elastic while it’s finite when we do things we like time slows down and molds around us while in a rote repetition doing the same thing every day we can say we’ve lived a lifetime but also only 1 day. Experience affects our life and perception of our finite time. We live unconscious adopting a one sized all life path when we should instead think and adopt our norms. We live unconscious going through the motions living someone else’s life then die. Ask the hard questions of life transcendence comes from within. While life has changed the ideas and feelings have remained the same we want to have food be warm have friends and love. Want to be healthy we like good food and the sun. We exist in multitudes and have many dimensions to our life but also we have dominant personality at different times. Who are we? Truth of who we are is rooted in the story we tell ourselves about ourselves. Do we have a true self can we find that person.

> Embrace the Gift of Mortality

Summary:
Experiencing a near-death situation can profoundly reshape one’s perspective on life and purpose.

In moments of imminent death, a deep sense of clarity often surfaces, revealing regrets about unfulfilled potential and the realization of life's fragility. Such experiences can ignite a commitment to live with intention, express love openly, and seek forgiveness quickly.

It highlights the significance of letting go of ego-driven comparisons and guilt, fostering a more compassionate self-dialogue.

True forgiveness emerges when it originates from love, transcending the need for apologies.

Recognizing that life can change in an instant encourages a focus on leaving a meaningful impact, prioritizing relationships, and contributing positively to the world. Ultimately, the challenges faced in life become essential catalysts for personal growth and purpose.

You were in a very high profile crisis once in the plane that Sully landed on the Hudson River, I think in the front row seat. Can you describe the last five minutes of that experience? The experience I think was three and a half minutes.

Speaker 1
So I think you're like little, the whole thing. Look, it's the greatest gift one can get. It's the greatest gift to know that you're going to die.

Speaker 2
Were you certain of that?

Speaker 1
A hundred percent certain. It was either I'm going to blow up, and that will be a lot better than breaking into pieces in January 15th in the Hudson River in New York and freezing in 40 seconds. If you were given those two options, I think blowing up is better. And then you have 90 seconds to say goodbye to your life with no suffering, zero suffering. And then on the other side of this, no one dies. So you can talk about it and celebrate it and understand it at a time where our country was an incredible crisis. We were coming out of the financial crisis of, wait, this country was in a low place looking for a story. So we were really lucky that we had the most incredible pilot on that seat that day that in many ways, and we can talk about him, he'd been preparing for that moment his whole life. He was a gliding instructor. Later on, I've gotten to know him really well. And you say you're only a pilot when you lose an engine. Otherwise, you're just managing the autopilot or whatever the inputs in the computer. In that day, it was a New York call day. I was coming home to Charlotte. My biggest concern was landing and coaching my son's basketball practice. And as we take off, there's a large explosion in the plane. Bam! Half asleep as you're taking off you realize I look at the flight attendant and I'm in 1D so I can see the flight attendant. There's nothing in their face just like annoyance if like this is gonna be and whatever because we turn the plane right away and nothing is happening. Smoke is coming in, you can hear the engine struggling but you think we're just going to go back landing. We're not that high, probably 3,000, 4,000 feet high. And then all of a sudden Sully gets on the microphone and says, this is your captain. So he identifies himself. And he says three words, the only three words he said. And this was the moment. He says, brace for impact. The movie is actually very true to a lot of it, especially to this. But at that moment, I look back at the flight attendant, Patrick, and then all of a sudden, it's complete terror in her eyes. She's like, holy cow, in training, this is we are not landing at an airport. I don't know that, but I can see her eyes, and I know that. That's what it means. And the great gift of that day was 90 seconds to literally say, it's over. I am sitting there going like, oh my goodness, it's over. Not only is it over, and then some people, you may have a near-death experience of a second or two seconds, this is a minute and a half, to basically sign off from life. And that's for me been super formative. Previous to this last year and a half, it was a real moment of kind of resignation in life. And lots of things happen from how have I dealt with spiritual beliefs from that time all the way to how it did impact my life. And I did that TED talk, not knowing that it would ever get published. But by the way, it was the greatest gift I give myself because people talk about it. And it's a reminder of me of a promise I made to myself that day, which is I was not going to let that experience. Someday, I wanted to be a part of me, not something that happened to me. I've tried to live very hard, very consciously of the gift I got that day.

Speaker 2
Can you remember sequentially what went through your head in those 90 seconds?

Speaker 1
Yeah, when I think about it, and I think about it now more evolved with time behind is a Lot of it had to do with the immediate emotion that I felt was just oh, no, it's over Is this sense of Real regret that it's over and there were so many things I had left undone? It all changed an instant. Life changes in an instant. We all have had friends that things have happened to in an instant. And I think in our evolution, we're unable to process that because we would have never left the cave if we felt that, right? So there's this concept called hedonic adaptation that we will adapt to whatever situation, that's what life is about we have adopted this thing and that was for me this notion of gosh When the plane landed I am gonna live with intense purpose every day I am gonna ask for forgiveness the moment I do something wrong I'm gonna drink my best wines whenever the person is There I'm gonna to say, I love you to anybody I love. I am going to try my very best every day to try to like not regret not doing or saying something. And that was wonderful. So I live out loud, so to speak, because I know it's going to change in an instant. Tomorrow may be that instant and I'm not having that regret if it happens. The second thing that I thought about it was like you're going to super human, right? You're adrenaline is shooting, you're in survival mode, you're going to die. There was this sense of, almost embarrassment, of how much I had allowed my ego to be who showed up in the world. How much I had spent energy being wronged by people, or being more or less than, better or worse than, how much my ego played a role in how I showed up every day. And it was this notion that, you know what, I hate it. I hated what that meant, and that I didn't realize that that was a mask that I was putting on and that I didn't need to have that mask on. That ego started with, okay, where does that come from? And for me Patrick was a lot of learning. I have this moment when the plane is gonna crash. We talked about religion a bit today and I don't share this a lot. I don't know how people take it but I ask myself, okay, do I buy insurance? I can ask for forgiveness. I was raised Catholic. I can ask for insurance right now and for sure if there is such a thing and I was not, I'm not a practicing Catholic or wasn't at the time a practicing Catholic and I said to myself I am not Because I'm not a hypocrite. I may be all flawed in many ways but it's not that and it just didn't feel natural to me. And what happened as a result to me after that, after just saying, hey, this is who I am, is I let go of all guilt. Not that I don't take responsibility, but the forgiveness happened to myself at the moment. It's like I no longer had this notion, and I think guilt drives a lot of our ego, a lot of our comparison set, a lot of this notion of having to be right versus choosing to be happy. And look, this is not a perfect journey. And at times your ego gets caught up in this and your ego gets in the way. Trust me, compared to when this happened, I am incredibly, incredibly lighter. I don't wanna die, and I don't want the ego to be the one that shows up every day. And as a result the

We don't put our emphasis on the journey part. We put our emphasis on the destination part. And we assume that the destination is going to come with a lot of happiness. This is a bias that researchers have called the arrival fallacy. I'll be happy when, you know, it's almost like the happily ever after. I'll be happily ever after if I get that promotion or happily ever after when I meet that person. And what we know from hedonic adaptation is that thing that's awesome in the moment when you arrive there quickly becomes the other thing. You mentioned briefly the gold medalists who have this moment where it's like they won the gold medal and that's awesome. But now everything else is downhill or I just got to do it again, right? We arrive at the best possible place we could have fantasized and instantly it's like, I just have to start chasing the next carrot. So sometimes when we find ourselves, I think as Americans, you know, chasing after the thing, I think it's important to remember that first of all, that chase is going to involve lots Of ups and downs. It's not going to be a linear path. It's probably not going to be overnight. Even the ones you mentioned, maybe with the exception of a really extreme case, required some kind of work and ups and downs and these kinds of things, right? We don't see those. But more, the happiness that we're going to get, it's better off if we're going not for the end result, that arrival and falling prey to the arrival fallacy. It's better if we can see some happiness in the journey. This has often been called this idea of sort of finding a journey mindset, which is sort of what can you take from the process of getting there, right? So you want to run your 5K, but like what can you do to try to enjoy the process of, you know, those runs that go along the way and noticing the kind of ups and downs and sort of paying attention To the journey. It's one way to kind of break out of falling prey to this arrival fallacy.

Andrew Huberman
Requires a serious frame shift. Totally.

Laurie Santos
And I think one that, you know, is not culturally accepted in the US. And I think this causes a lot of, you know, it causes a happiness hit, not just because like, sometimes we don't get there. Sometimes there's reason, you know, if you set your height super high, you know, you want to be Roger Bannister or whatever, like not all of us are going to get there, that's a four-minute Mile or success at work or $50 million or whatever it is. So sometimes if you set your sights too high, you just don't get there. And so that's a happiness hit. But a bigger – and sometimes when you do get there, it's a happiness hit because you get there and there's a happiness for a moment. But then, you know, that hit doesn't keep coming. I think we also just lose out on something when we're not in that journey mindset, because there's a lot of cool stuff along the way if we can kind of pay attention. But yeah, I think it's a big cultural shift from the way Americans usually think, but it's one that if we can achieve that, we'll start feeling a lot better. And it means even the failures in life are kind of good, because you are enjoying yourself along the way. For my podcast, I did an episode about these sort of Olympic medals where I talked about that, you know, the bronze lining effect and things. And I had Michelle Kwan, who, you know, Olympic medalist, we all remember her, but mostly just won silver. And I talked to her about, you know, what that felt like. And she said, it didn't matter to me. The things I loved about being Olympics wasn't the medal stand. It was when she first, she talked about putting her skates on and seeing the rings in the ice and recognizing as soon as I tie these laces, I'm going to get to skate over those. And I fantasize that's the journey mindset, right? You're not looking at the thing at the end, you're paying enough attention to the stuff along the way, even some of the stuff that's a pain in the butt that you kind of get some joy on the Ride.

Andrew Huberman
I certainly have learned to relish in the failures as well as the successes. And I think some of that also just comes with age. I've always wanted to say that. It's true though. It kind of comes with age.

Laurie Santos
You're old enough now, Andrew. You can jump into it.

Andrew Huberman
Yeah. You accrue enough experiences, good and bad and neutral. And you kind of go like, the other day I was in this kind of weird state of mind. I was like, wait, I've been here before. Like this shifts, like no worries. Like this shifts and then sure enough, it shifted. You know, like I think the first time we find ourself in a place or we find ourself back in a place and we forget we've been there before for whatever reason, or we try and pretend we haven't Been there before. It's like, and then you go through enough of those cycles, like, okay, this is part of a larger trajectory. It's an amazing thing about the brain I never understood, I still don't, which is that when we're feeling happy, we don't tend to think, gosh, this feeling is going to go away. Sometimes a little bit of that, but when we're feeling lousy, it does seem to do something to our sense of time, our time perception that makes it seem, especially in the real lows, in The real trenches, that it's going to go on forever. We can't imagine feeling differently. The this too shall pass is very hard to internalize when we're in those states. Totally.

Laurie Santos
But it can make you feel a lot. If you can get that distance from your current state, and this is a kind of, you know, you had Ethan Cross on the show. He talks a lot, a lot. If you can kind of get that distance of, well, how's this going to feel in five years? How's this going to feel in 10 years? You can sometimes feel a lot better. Interestingly, even when the happy stuff, if we can get some sense that like this isn't going to last forever, that can sometimes boost the happiness. Because we're kind of almost doing like a negative visualization in the forward direction, right? So a scarce experience, if you're having it, it's useful to remember like, you know, this is limited, right? This is temporary. I should enjoy this now while it's happening. The most extreme version of this, of course, is with our own lives, right? Contemplating our mortality. There's this idea of memento mori, which is a common phrase. I actually have my ring has memento mori on it, which is morbid, right? I'm going to die. I'm not going to be here. But when you recognize that, you know, the old school folks thought, and I think it's true, like you realize like, I can't take any of this stuff for granted. I have to pay attention now. This is not, you know, the kind of thing that's going to last forever. And so I think moments like that for positive experiences can feel like that. You know, if you're tasting a delicious glass of Pinot Noir sitting, yesterday I was, and you know, while I'm here, you know, took a walk on Santa Monica Beach and was like, you know, my Brain was like, oh, I have to, Andrew coming out. I was like, no, no, I'm going to like fly back to cold, you know, East Coast tomorrow. I need to pay attention, right? So thinking that this is finite can actually help you. There's a very funny study on this with college students where they did this sort of funny framing technique where they brought senior college students into lab, you know, kind of halfway Through, you know, the spring semester and told them, you know, you either have this many hours less of your time, which is a big number. You know, it makes it seem like thousands of hours. Or you have only this many days left before you graduate. Just like just a reminder. What they found was the one that got the days manipulation where it felt kind of short, they wound up doing more things, like kind of getting in those things that they t...

His teaching once made were fixed and unchanging. Dynamic pleasures consistent the attainment of a desired end like eating, and static pleasures are that desired and state like the state of feeling full. Static is a state of equilibrium. Regards absence of pain than gluttony. He thought better to eat to be not hungry than eat to be full. Believed in common sense and minding your own business not great philosophical doctrines. Believed all men were focused on selfish pleasures but also in friendship and the power of it. Was focused on avoiding fear and death. Hated and rejected religion very hostile religion in the old times could’ve been different for different peoples like rich and poor that we don’t have good info on poor people in history so we don’t fully understand their lives. believed in materialism and rejected mortality and this was very different from Christianity so non existence as a deliverance.

> 4.3
People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. – escape through meditation

What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration:
• that rational beings exist for one another;
• that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience;
• that no one does the wrong thing deliberately;
• and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried. . . . and keep your mouth shut. – you need to work to do what is right assume people are good and the cycle of hate never stops

Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are. – your reputation does not matter soon we will all be dead

things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within—from our own perception – events do not effect you only your reaction to those events gives them agency to effect you

everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen. “The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.” – the world is always changing

> Reflections on Life: Birth, Death, and Regrets

Key takeaways:
- Most people have not thought about the events of birth and death, and it's as if we shelter younger generations from them.
- There is no certainty about what happens to us after our death.
- Knowing that our time on earth is limited makes us want to make the most of it and leave a trail.
- Having as few regrets as possible is important. Regrets are different from mistakes and often come from not doing something you wish you had done.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
We all experience both completely alone. And yet most people of your age have not thought about these events very much, much less even seen them in others. How many of you have seen the birth of another human? It's a miracle. And how many of you have witnessed the death of a human? It is a mystery beyond our comprehension. No human alive knows what happens to us after our death. Some believe this, others that, but no one really knows. Again, most people of your age have not thought about these events very much. It's as if we shelter you from them, afraid that the thought of mortality will somehow wound you. For me, it's the opposite. To know my arc will fall makes me want to blaze while I'm in the sky. Not for others, but for myself, for the trail that I know that I'm leaving. And I love the way he ends his speech. Now, as you live your arc across the sky, you want to have as few regrets as possible. Remember, regrets are different from mistakes. Mistakes are those things that you did and you wish you could do over again. In some, you were a fool. In others, he says, usually concerning women. That's hilarious. In some, you were a fool, usually concerning women. In others, you were scared. In others, you hurt someone else. Some mistakes are deep and others are not. But if your intent was pure, then they are almost always enriching in some way. So mistakes are things that you did and wish you could do over again. Regrets are most often things you didn't do and wish you did. So then right before he goes back to Apple, Steve gives an interview that's all about Pixar.

**Note:** Actionable principle - when death is the hunter, there's no room for regrets or doubts, only decisions. Take full responsibility for choices knowing you may die at any time

> Explanations arent necessary, only action. When man decides to do some thing, he must go all the way, but take responsibility for what he does. You must first know why he’s doing it and then proceeded without doubts with his actions. There is no room for regrets for remorse. Don Juan sees himself as able to die at any time and accepts that. He has no room for death or remorse if he is to die he must die. He can’t be preoccupied with death. Carlos sees himself as immortal and that leads to regret and self doubt. When death is the hunter there is no room for regrets or doubts just decisions. To assume the responsibility of your decisions means you’re willing to die for them even if someone presents an idea you need to buy in fully if you accept to do it. In the world, where death is the Hunter there are no bigger small decisions. Just decisions we make in the face of our inevitable death. Carlos tells a story of off his dad setting an alarm to get up at 6 am to swim he’d get out of bed stretch then fall asleep for another 4-6 hours. Carlos thought his dad was a weak man for this. But Don Juan thought that Carlos should’ve still swam even without his dad. Commitments are to ourselves. If he agreed to go it doesn’t matter if his dad didn’t. The story of the gourds and spirit deer. A man down on his luck stumbled on an older man with gords he wanted help moving to the mountains the young man was starving and given food and then the old man summoned a spirit deee and gave the young man the option of the gords or the deer to guide him in life. The man thinking there was more than food in the gords deliberated and took those to only find food. Then he smashed them on a rock in anger. Thinking he had made the wrong decision. He didn’t understand his decision or his power. A starving man throwing out food he needed because it wasn’t a spirit guide is ironic and demonstrates a misunderstanding of power and living with your decisions in life.

The portrait would be what holiness is to some and consciousness to others, and the fear of God is to everyone something to guide his life. Dorian then apologizes to Sybil. There’s a luxuryin Self for reapproach. We feel when we blame ourselves. No one can blame us. It is the confession not the priest that gives us absolution. When he finished the letter he felt he had been forgiven. One can always be kind about those we feel indifferent to. A woman can only reform a man by boring him so much he loses all interest in life. There’s a fatality that good resolutions always come to late. They make us feel good but it’s the opioid of the weak. Sybil kills herself and Dorian feels bad Henry makes a point that this was like a dramatic play and often in the dramatic moments of our lives we aren’t the actors in the plays of our life but the spectators. The best thing about the past is it is the past. People never know when the curtain has fallen on life and parts in it they always want another act. We must move on. A good Conscience makes one vain. Women appreciate cruelty more than anyone they love being dominated. In Sybil’s death when she finally became herself and touched reality she died. She died like Dorian knew her another act in a play. She died for love for him.

> Christopher Nolan's Journey as a Filmmaker

Summary:
Christopher Nolan, at the age of 27, completed his first film on a shoestring budget and strategically edited it for a simultaneous release to open up unforeseen opportunities.

Anticipating the success of his first film, he already had the concept of 'Memento,' his second film, ready. Despite initial rejections from film school, Nolan remained focused on new creative ideas and developed a complex narrative structure for 'Memento,' which garnered critical acclaim.

Nolan's ability to believe in his vision, adapt to challenges, and plan for future projects contributed to his success as a filmmaker.

Transcript:
Speaker 1
And so Christopher Nolan is going to get this first movie, this following movie, finished in 1987. He is 27. I want to bring this to your attention. This is what Christopher Nolan was doing at 27. He's got this film. It's created on like the shoestring budget. He's about to edit and release it at the same time, though. He does something smart. Like this is another example of doing the best you can with the job in front of you. And by doing so, like you can open up opportunities that you can't possibly predict. He had already known. He's like, OK, when this is done, if this is well received, I need to have another project because he doesn't want to work. He wants to work. Be a filmmaker full time, right? So it's like, let's say this comes out. I think it's good. I can convince other people it's good. Then what's going to happen is once it's good and it starts spread, like being come and critically acclaimed, maybe making a little bit of money, distributors and other movie series. I'm like, hey, do you have anything next? He already had the idea for Memento. This is his second film. This is the thing that that causes his critical vertical. Listen to this description of what he was doing at 27 years old. Rather than being discouraged by his rejection from film school, he was hot on a new idea for a movie. The story of a guy who loses his short term memory and tries to solve the murder of his wife by tattooing clues on his body, like little Mementos. It sounded complicated. Chris also wanted to tell the story backward. That was very important. He said, I couldn't quite see it. But when you're around someone who does, you start to believe it. And so they finished the following. It is extremely well received, gets written about in all the major papers in San Francisco and New York. And so then people would ask him, okay, what do you want to do next? Do you have another idea?
