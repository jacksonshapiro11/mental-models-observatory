## 1. Code 13B

**OLD NAME:** Social Reality Construction & Collective Belief  
**NEW NAME:** Social Identity & Group Belonging  
**Description Similarity:** 8.0%

### OLD Model (from MENTAL_MODELS_COMPLETE.md):

**Model ID:** `cultural-anthropology-social-identity-13b`  
**Slug:** `social-reality-construction-collective-belief`  
**Difficulty:** 🟡 intermediate

#### Description

How group membership shapes individual behavior and thinking

#### Core Principles

1. We have concepts like parliament which are real but also aren't they're only real because we believe it's real. If we all stopped believing at a societal level it would be reduced to a useless idea. Social institutions are as real as mountains but also can crumble - this is the idea of societal paradigms that dictate every interaction but can be completely upended in one second.

#### Applications

1. Understanding how social reality is constructed
2. recognizing the power of collective belief
3. appreciating the paradox of shared fictions
4. designing interventions that shift collective understanding
5. seeing through constructed social categories

## 2. Code 14B

**OLD NAME:** Semantics vs. Meaning & Deep Understanding  
**NEW NAME:** Communication Bandwidth & Medium Constraints  
**Description Similarity:** 0.0%

### OLD Model (from MENTAL_MODELS_COMPLETE.md):

**Model ID:** `language-communication-systems-14b`  
**Slug:** `semantics-vs-meaning-deep-understanding`  
**Difficulty:** 🟡 intermediate

#### Description

The distinction between word definitions and experiential understanding

#### Core Principles

1. There's the word and the object language is just a comprehension model. Description isn't understanding. What a computer sees as a chair isn't the full understanding of chair. Language is a mental model for communication but description isn't understanding. Semantics vs meaning.

#### Applications

1. Distinguishing between knowing definitions and true understanding
2. recognizing when language obscures rather than clarifies
3. designing communication that conveys meaning not just information
4. building experiential rather than just semantic knowledge

## 3. Code 15C

**OLD NAME:** Predictive Processing & Constructed Experience  
**NEW NAME:** Media as Reality Constructor  
**Description Similarity:** 5.3%

### OLD Model (from MENTAL_MODELS_COMPLETE.md):

**Model ID:** `information-theory-media-ecology-15c`  
**Slug:** `predictive-processing-constructed-experience`  
**Difficulty:** 🟡 intermediate

#### Description

How the mind constructs reality from information

#### Core Principles

1. Predictive processing says that we don't experience the world as it is, but as we predict it to be. Our conscious experience is a construction of layered mental habits acquired through past experiences. We don't see the world through our eye sockets; these all feed information into our brains, which conjure our experience of the world from scratch.

#### Applications

1. Understanding that experience is constructed not directly perceived
2. recognizing how past conditioning shapes present experience
3. using meditation to deconstruct automatic mental habits
4. seeing through the illusion of direct perception

## 4. Code 18A

**OLD NAME:** Love as Nuclear Fuel & Life Foundation  
**NEW NAME:** Quality vs. Quantity in Relationships  
**Description Similarity:** 4.2%

### OLD Model (from MENTAL_MODELS_COMPLETE.md):

**Model ID:** `relationships-human-connection-18a`  
**Slug:** `love-as-nuclear-fuel-life-foundation`  
**Difficulty:** 🟡 intermediate

#### Description

Understanding deep human bonds beyond mere emotion

#### Core Principles

1. Love and fear are opposites. Love and hatred are not opposites. Hatred is downstream from fear. Love is the nuclear fuel that runs happiness.

People who are in their 80s and 90s who are really happy, what they all have in common is drawing relationships that they were cultivating and working on, real love relationships.

#### Applications

1. Prioritizing relationship building and maintenance
2. giving genuine thanks rather than patronizing praise
3. helping others feel useful and valued
4. building balanced power dynamics
5. fostering mutual benefit rather than dependence

## 5. Code 18D

**OLD NAME:** Compounding Human Connections  
**NEW NAME:** Attachment & Interdependence  
**Description Similarity:** 4.8%

### OLD Model (from MENTAL_MODELS_COMPLETE.md):

**Model ID:** `relationships-human-connection-18d`  
**Slug:** `compounding-human-connections`  
**Difficulty:** 🟡 intermediate

#### Description

How relationships build on each other over time

#### Core Principles

1. Working with the same people over decades - all the knowledge we have working with each other it compounds and that compounding makes it easier for us to communicate and work faster.

**Slug:** `physiological-states-decision-quality`  
**Difficulty:** 🟡 intermediate

#### Description

How physical state affects mental performance

#### Core Principles

1. Our physiology restricts our mental state. Stress cuts off blood flow to your brain. If you are in a highly sympathetic state, you're much more likely to be myopic. You're in a survival state.

**Difficulty:** 🟡 intermediate

#### Description

Understanding the connection between physical and mental states

## Summary

**9 models total** that have been replaced with different content:

- Domain 13: 1 model (13B)
- Domain 14: 1 model (14B)
- Domain 15: 1 model (15C)
- Domain 18: 2 models (18A, 18D)
- Domain 19: 1 model (19C)
- Domain 20: 3 models (20B, 20C, 20D)

**Decision needed:** Should these old models be:
1. Completely replaced by the new versions (current state)?
2. Added back as separate models with new codes?
3. Merged/combined with the new models somehow?
