#### Applications

1. Focusing on decision process rather than outcomes

2. understanding role of luck vs. skill

3. learning from both successes and failures objectively

4. maintaining good decision hygiene

5. keeping decision journals.

**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Weighing potential outcomes by their probability and magnitude

#### Core Principles

1. Asymmetric risk and scale. When risk is even but pay offs are non linear. Angel bets and venture bets are great because they bound your outcome in the negative, but on the upside, you can make 10,000 X. So I try to rig the game. Exponential upside and zero downside is the ideal framework.

#### Applications

1. Evaluating investment and career decisions

2. designing insurance and hedging strategies

3. understanding when to take calculated risks

### Probabilistic Thinking & Base Rate Neglect

**Model ID:** `decision-making-under-uncertainty-7a`  
**Slug:** `probabilistic-thinking-base-rate-neglect`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Thinking in terms of likelihoods and using statistical baselines

#### Core Principles

1. We need to think grey instead of thinking in certainties either 100% or 0%. The inside view vs the outside view. How the people in the group think it will go and how other groups performed in the same task. If the data is reliable the outside view is the base rate and the inside view is the intuition about the specific situation. Find a good reference class for the problem find useful statistics in that reference class then use specifics of the case to adjust from there.

#### Examples

1. When estimating how long a software project will take, start with how long similar projects took in the past (base rate), then adjust for your team's specific skills and project complexity (inside view).

2. A doctor diagnosing a patient should consider the prevalence of diseases in the population (base rate) before focusing on specific symptoms, avoiding the representativeness heuristic.

3. Investors should look at the historical success rate of startups in a sector (base rate) before getting excited about a specific company's pitch (inside view).

#### Applications

1. Making better predictions by starting with base rates

2. avoiding overconfidence in uncertain situations

3. designing decision processes that account for multiple scenarios

4. distinguishing inside view from outside view

5. thinking in probabilities not certainties.

**Slug:** `the-power-of-daily-compounding`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

How 1% daily improvements create dramatic long-term changes

#### Core Principles

1. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. A small source could lead to outsized results through compounding. If buffet started investing from 20-65 he would've made only $12mm but since he did it from 10-90 the extra compounding time has made him $100 bn. 1% daily increase creates a big change over time and changes happen when you cross a critical threshold.

#### Applications

1. Building daily systems that compound positively

2. understanding why small changes are invisible initially but powerful over time

3. avoiding negative compounding behaviors

4. designing life for long-term exponential growth.

**Slug:** `critical-approach-fallibilism`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Understanding that knowledge is provisional and must be tested

#### Core Principles

1. There are no ultimate sources of knowledge just suggestions we need to test. The proper question is about asking about truth not about who told us justified belief. Test assertion. Knowledge doesn't start blank but builds on previous knowledge usually we're kinda right. Errors help us learn. Our knowledge is finite ignorance infinite. Truth is beyond human authority.

#### Applications

1. Testing ideas rather than accepting authority

2. understanding that knowledge builds on previous knowledge

3. embracing error as part of learning

**Slug:** `good-explanations-vs-prophecy`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Distinguishing between explanatory theories and mere prediction

#### Core Principles

1. The essence of science isn't prediction it's good explanations. Science isn't about being right it's about advancing into parts unknown pushing the frontier constantly. With increasing content the probability of it being true decreases but we should seek very explanatory low probability insights. If we aim to acquire more knowledge we must aim for less probable hypotheses.

#### Applications

1. Focusing on understanding rather than prediction

2. seeking explanatory depth

3. being willing to consider low-probability but high-explanation theories

4. distinguishing correlation from causation.

**Slug:** `the-ladder-vs-the-spectrum-thinking-about-thinking`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

How we think matters more than what we think

#### Core Principles

1. The spectrum is what we think which isn't really material either way. The ladder or how we think is much more important. The scientist wants to the truth so bad you are relentlessly error seeking. High rung wants to be right in the long term not the moment while low rung wants to win. The zealot wants to win at all costs and won't change his mind.

#### Applications

1. Focusing on quality of thinking process rather than positions held

2. developing scientist-like relentless error-seeking

3. avoiding zealot-like identity protection

#### Description

Understanding how space and time are unified and relative to the observer

#### Core Principles

1. Einstein said we live in a world of particles and fields and space time is curved and influenced by mass. There is the past and the future but also the intermediate present because the speed of light can only carry information so fast there is no concept of now. Everything is relative. Now on earth is 15 minutes later on mars or 2 million years later on andromeda.

#### Applications

1. Understanding that observation depends on reference frame

2. recognizing that simultaneity is relative

3. appreciating how gravity affects time

4. designing systems that account for relativistic effects at scale.

**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed - the fundamental constraint underlying all systems

#### Core Principles

1. Energy underlies every decision and drives societal complexity forward. To increase societal complexity or even live, everything needs energy. Whenever energy is utilized some energy is lost as useless energy as a byproduct that creates chaos and trends the works toward more uncertainty. The entire human history represents increasingly efficient uses and transference of energy. We take ordered nuclear energy and make it more chaotic in our use.

#### Applications

1. Understanding that all growth requires energy input

2. recognizing entropy as the byproduct of organization

3. designing systems that account for energy losses

**Slug:** `power-concentration-natural-centralization`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

Understanding how power naturally flows and consolidates

#### Core Principles

1. Power natural converges to the center and it is ineffective when divided. The first condition of freedom is limitation make it absolute and it dies in chaos. Violent revolutions do not redistribute wealth but destroy it. The only revolution is in the enlightenment of the mind and the improvement of character, the only real emancipation is individual.

#### Applications

1. Understanding why power concentrates

2. designing systems with appropriate checks and balances

3. recognizing that sustainable change comes through individual development rather than forced redistribution

**Slug:** `power-games-vs-authentic-strength`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

Distinguishing between power over others and true personal power

#### Core Principles

1. We play power games to be right which leads to suffering don't defend some fake identity but be conscious and lose this identity that creates power games. Power over others is weakness disguised as strength true power is within and always available. The need to feel right for self preservation leads to a lot of suffering so lose that.

#### Applications

1. Recognizing when engaged in ego-driven power games

2. developing authentic inner power rather than power over others

3. avoiding the need to be right at all costs

4. building influence through competence and character rather than domination.

**Slug:** `regulatory-capture-institutional-decay`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

How institutions become captured by the interests they're meant to regulate

#### Core Principles

1. Policy resistance comes from bounded rationality when goals of sub systems are different from the goals of the system as a whole. In a policy resistant system actors drag the system where no one wants. War on drugs government bans drugs prices go up addicts rob more people and drug lords can afford more expensive transit methods.

#### Applications

1. Recognizing when institutions serve special interests rather than public good

2. designing systems with aligned incentives

3. understanding unintended consequences of policies

4. identifying regulatory capture

5. creating accountability mechanisms.

**Slug:** `cognitive-biases-systematic-errors`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

The systematic ways human thinking deviates from rational models

#### Core Principles

1. Availability influences your opinion if you can think of things easier than you're more likely to associate yourself with those things. Confirmation bias trying to confirm instead of search for truth. What you see is all their is you can't conceptualize the unknown unknowns. The affect heuristic people make decision based on their emotions.

#### Examples

1. After watching news about plane crashes, people overestimate the danger of flying (availability bias) despite statistics showing it's safer than driving.

2. A manager only notices evidence that supports their decision to hire someone, ignoring red flags (confirmation bias).

3. Investors panic-sell during market downturns because recent losses feel more significant than historical market recoveries (recency bias).

#### Applications

1. Recognizing high-stakes situations where biases are dangerous

2. building decision processes that counteract predictable errors

3. understanding why certain information spreads more easily

**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

How context and reference points shape our perception of value and decision-making

#### Core Principles

1. Mental accounting we view things differently based on a reference point. People who stray from the default and fail are much more likely to regret things than the opposite of people who do the accepted thing and fail. Reference point - risk value which we anchor to. We value losses greater than gains.

#### Applications

1. Understanding how framing affects decisions

2. recognizing the power of reference points

3. designing choices that account for mental accounting

**Slug:** `social-psychology-environmental-influence`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

How we are shaped by social context and others' expectations

#### Core Principles

1. Social and physical environment shape our behavior. People are more likely to liter in areas that look worse ie broken window theory of crime. There are cues like skin, color or music that stimulate a perception of someone similar to the priming. These relationships aren't fully true but the stereotypes we learn create our perceptions of reality.

#### Applications

1. Understanding how social context shapes behavior

2. recognizing unconscious influences

3. designing environments that promote desired behaviors

4. being aware of priming effects

5. creating positive environmental cues.

**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

The dual-process theory of how our minds operate under different conditions

#### Core Principles

1. Mental life is conducted at a stroll and only rarely are we engaging system 2 in an effortful jog or run. System one operates automatically, quickly based on patterns. We solve by easy steps and work by the law of least effort. Jumping to conclusions is good when cost for mistakes are low and bad when they are high. System 2 raises flags when something is outside the norm.

#### Applications

1. Recognizing when to slow down and engage deliberate thinking

2. designing decision processes that account for cognitive limitations

3. creating environments that support System 2 when needed

4. understanding why most people rely on intuitive shortcuts.

**Slug:** `boundaries-system-definition`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

Understanding how we define and separate systems from their environments

#### Core Principles

1. Boundaries only exist within models but you must draw them they are completely arbitrary but they are key to differentiating the system. We must understand these are not real and that they are key source/ choke point of the system. Most arguments come over boundaries rich and poor border disputes etc. We must be mindful to understand boundaries but realize we cannot take into account every small boundary.

#### Applications

1. Recognizing that boundaries are modeling choices

2. understanding how boundary definitions affect system behavior

3. being thoughtful about where to draw system boundaries

4. realizing that boundaries in reality are more fluid than models suggest.

1. People condemned things for aesthetic and not results things looked ugly so were viewed unfavorably but they actually had a ton of local knowledge that while looking wrong had a deeper sense of truth than the "ordered" method. We organize the world into spatiotemporal zones but to think that is fully reality is crazy.

#### Applications

1. Recognizing patterns while avoiding over-interpretation

2. understanding how aesthetic bias affects analysis

3. being conscious of statistical biases

4. appreciating that functionally superior solutions may appear aesthetically displeasing

5. building adequate sample sizes.

### Statistical Inference & Sample Size Awareness

**Model ID:** `statistics-data-science-31a`  
**Slug:** `statistical-inference-sample-size-awareness`  
**Difficulty:** 游릭 beginner  

#### Description

Drawing reliable conclusions from incomplete data

#### Core Principles

1. The law of small numbers leads to drawing conclusions from insufficient data. Markov chains obey the law of large numbers but also deterministic and depending on what is around it. Locally it's predictive but globally all predictions are still equal to the actual probability. Mind the sample size of a decision set.

#### Applications

1. Understanding how local patterns relate to global trends

2. recognizing when statistical models apply

3. balancing pattern recognition with uncertainty

4. designing experiments that yield reliable insights

5. avoiding small sample fallacies.

## Systems Thinking & Complexity

*4 mental models*

### Emergence & Complex Adaptive Systems

**Model ID:** `systems-thinking-complexity-4c`  
**Slug:** `emergence-complex-adaptive-systems`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

How complex behavior arises from simple interactions between system components

#### Core Principles

1. Complex adaptive systems have many levels of organization with lower level building blocks forming higher level organisms. A system is more than the sum of its parts and exhibits adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking behavior. At the intersection of order and chaos, between macro emergent structures and micro interactions, knowledge and novelty are created. Complex adaptive systems are perpetual novelty.

#### Applications

1. Understanding why reductionist approaches often fail with complex systems

2. designing systems that encourage positive emergent behaviors

3. recognizing when problems require intervention at different levels of emergence

4. working with rather than against emergent properties.

**Tags:** systems, behavior, interaction

### Feedback Loops & System Dynamics

**Model ID:** `systems-thinking-complexity-4b`  
**Slug:** `feedback-loops-system-dynamics`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

How information flows create self-reinforcing or self-correcting patterns

#### Core Principles

1. When a behavior persists over time there is likely a mechanism creating that behavior which is a feedback loop. Reinforcing feedback loop leads to exponential growth or complete erosion eventually leads to runaway effects and destruction. When one loop dominates another it has an outsized effect on the system. You can have 10 different feedback loops but one could have a 99% influence so it dominates the system.

#### Applications

1. Identifying what's driving persistent system behaviors

2. designing feedback mechanisms that maintain desired performance

3. understanding why some changes accelerate while others stabilize

4. finding the 99% influence loop.

**Tags:** information, feedback

### Leverage Points & High-Impact Interventions

**Model ID:** `systems-thinking-complexity-4d`  
**Slug:** `leverage-points-high-impact-interventions`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Identifying the places in a system where small changes produce big impacts

#### Core Principles

1. Leverage points the place where you can make the most effect in a system with the least resources. The most highest ev place to intervene. These can often be counterintuitive. The lowest leverage point is numbers. Transcending paradigms is the highest leverage point - keep one's self unattached to the arenas of paradigms to be flexible and realize no one paradigm is wholly correct.

#### Applications

1. Finding and focusing on the highest-leverage interventions

2. understanding that systems resist change at high-leverage points

3. recognizing counterintuitive intervention points

4. developing ability to transcend paradigms rather than being trapped within them.

### Stocks, Flows & System Structure

**Model ID:** `systems-thinking-complexity-4a`  
**Slug:** `stocks-flows-system-structure`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

The fundamental building blocks that determine system behavior over time

#### Core Principles

1. Stocks are foundation of any system and they are the things you can feel count or measure over time like the books in a book store the wood in a forest or your self confidence. Stocks change through flows and stocks are the present memory of changing flows. System structure creates system behavior. While people look at the stock the flows ie rate of change in a system is much more important.

#### Applications

1. Identifying what to measure in any system

2. understanding why systems behave as they do over time

3. designing better feedback mechanisms

4. creating appropriate buffers without bloat

5. focusing on structural changes rather than event-level fixes.

**Tags:** time, behavior

**Model ID:** `technology-human-computer-interaction-16a`  
**Slug:** `human-computer-symbiosis-cognitive-augmentation`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

The integration of human and machine capabilities

#### Core Principles

1. Lick wrote his seminal paper on human computer symbiosis on how humans worked with computers. Computers lick saw could not only mitigate monotony but enhance creativity and create models. Computers allow peoples mental models the most complex of all models to be aided as computers are great at digesting complexity and humans aren't.

**Slug:** `technology-as-capability-amplifier`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

How technology scales human abilities and impacts

#### Core Principles

1. Technology as extension of human cognition within physical and energetic constraints. Tech moves so fast and that changes the world tech moving forward is a law of life. Invest heavily in tech to make a lot of money in any industry. Computing biology energy and manufacturing are undergoing exponential change currently.

#### Applications

1. Understanding technology as capability amplifier

2. recognizing exponential vs. linear technology growth

3. investing in technological capabilities

4. designing technology that enhances rather than replaces human abilities

## Temporal Dynamics & Flow States

*2 mental models*

### Flow States & Optimal Experience

**Model ID:** `temporal-dynamics-flow-states-11a`  
**Slug:** `flow-states-optimal-experience`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

The psychology of peak performance and deep engagement

#### Core Principles

1. Flow states, temporal coordination, rhythm, cycles, momentum, time perception, presence, consciousness without thought. People hate and deeply struggle with intractable problems and love to be pushed at the edge of flow. When you're doing a lot of cognition meta cognition is hard. The more skilled or talented you are at something the less attention you need to devote to it.

#### Applications

1. Designing work for flow states

2. understanding optimal challenge-skill balance

3. creating environments that support deep engagement

4. recognizing when you're in or out of flow

5. structuring activities to promote optimal experience.

**Tags:** psychology

### Temporal Coordination & System Rhythm

**Model ID:** `temporal-dynamics-flow-states-11b`  
**Slug:** `temporal-coordination-system-rhythm`  
**Difficulty:** 游리 intermediate  

#### Description

Understanding timing, cycles, and coordination across time

#### Core Principles

1. Feedback can only change future behavior a flow can't react to a flow instantly it can only change to a change in the stock. Models that assume immediate response to change in price are misguided so real economy and all feedback loops need time to respond. Delays cause oscillation in systems as we try to adjust.

#### Applications

1. Understanding that all systems have inherent delays

2. designing for temporal coordination

3. anticipating system oscillations

4. managing timing in complex systems

5. building buffers to handle temporal misalignment.

**Tags:** time

## Time & Mortality Awareness

*4 mental models*

### Finite Life Recognition & Atelic Activities

**Model ID:** `time-mortality-awareness-1c`  
**Slug:** `finite-life-recognition-atelic-activities`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Accepting the fundamental scarcity of time as the organizing principle

#### Core Principles

1. Life consists of approximately four thousand weeks - a finite, non-renewable resource. There is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don't use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return. Atelic activities are pursued for the experience itself rather than to accomplish a goal - hiking, music, dance, conversation. Unlike goal-oriented (telic) activities that can be "completed," atelic activities can never be done "enough of."

#### Applications

1. Making peace with not being able to do everything

2. choosing depth over breadth in relationships and pursuits

3. stopping the search for "life hacks" that promise unlimited capacity

4. embracing the poignancy of finite existence

5. engaging in activities done for their own sake.

### Memento Mori & Death as Teacher

**Model ID:** `time-mortality-awareness-1a`  
**Slug:** `memento-mori-death-as-teacher`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

"Remember you must die" - the practice of keeping mortality in conscious awareness

#### Core Principles

1. Death isn't a part of our lived experience but something experienced by others through grief. We never actually experience our own death, only the dying process. The anxiety about death often exceeds the reality - we suffer more in imagination than in actuality. Death acts as the ultimate advisor - when feeling overwhelmed or caught in petty concerns, turning to mortality perspective provides clarity about what truly matters. Death is always "to our left, at arm's length," watching until it taps us.

#### Applications

1. Daily reflection on mortality to prioritize meaningful activities

2. using death awareness to reduce petty concerns and ego-driven behavior

3. recognizing that external achievements cannot outlast our finite existence

4. when stressed about minor issues, ask "will this matter when I'm dying?"

### Present-Moment Elasticity & Time Perception

**Model ID:** `time-mortality-awareness-1d`  
**Slug:** `present-moment-elasticity-time-perception`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

How subjective experience of time varies with activity and attention

#### Core Principles

1. Time is elastic while it's finite - when we do things we like time slows down and molds around us while in rote repetition doing the same thing every day we can say we've lived a lifetime but also only 1 day. Experience affects our life and perception of our finite time. Time moves faster as we age because each year represents a smaller fraction of our total experience. Brief is this existence - a fleeting visit in a strange house.

#### Applications

1. Structuring activities to slow subjective time

2. understanding how engagement affects time perception

3. making the most of present moments

4. recognizing how routine affects time experience

5. meditation on the transience of experience.

**Tags:** time

### Regret vs. Mistakes Framework

**Model ID:** `time-mortality-awareness-1b`  
**Slug:** `regret-vs-mistakes-framework`  
**Difficulty:** 游댮 advanced  

#### Description

Understanding the difference between actions taken and opportunities missed

#### Core Principles

1. Mistakes are things you did and wish you could do differently - they often come from fear, foolishness, or poor judgment but can be enriching if your intent was pure. Regrets are things you didn't do and wish you had - they represent missed opportunities and unexplored paths. The regret minimization framework asks: "What will you least regret on your deathbed?" When you look back at your life at 20 years old with regret it's one thing, but when you do it at 75 it's brutal.

#### Applications

1. Making difficult decisions by imagining yourself at 80 looking back

2. choosing courage over comfort when facing important opportunities

3. recognizing that action with pure intent, even if it fails, beats inaction born of fear.
