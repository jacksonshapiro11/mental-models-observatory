# THE DAILY BRIEF

*Life is a game we all get to play. Make sure you're having fun — especially in the chaos.*

## Tuesday, February 24, 2026

*Anthropic broke IBM and cybersecurity in one day. AMD and Meta inked a $100B GPU deal overnight. El Mencho is dead. State of the Union tonight. NVIDIA tomorrow. The AI disruption wave just stopped being theoretical.*

# ▸ THE DASHBOARD

### Futures (Pre-Market)
| Index | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| S&P 500 Futures | 6,853.50 | +0.03% |
| Nasdaq 100 Futures | 24,838.50 | +0.31% |
| Dow Futures | 48,923 | +0.15% |

*Futures barely green after Monday's bloodbath. AMD +10% pre-market on the Meta deal is lifting Nasdaq futures. Home Depot beat ($2.72 EPS vs $2.54 est) adding 0.2% to Dow futures. The market is trying to stabilize but the AI disruption narrative from Monday hasn't resolved — it's just paused for earnings.*

### Equities (Monday Close)
| Index | Price | 1D | 5D | 1M | 1Y | 50D MA | 200D MA | 200W MA |

# ▸ THE SIX

## Markets & Macro
- **Monday was the worst day since the tariff shock last spring.** Dow -822 (-1.66%), S&P -1.04%, Nasdaq -1.13%. The trigger wasn't tariffs — it was AI. Anthropic's dual announcements (COBOL modernization + Claude Code Security) sent IBM down 13% and cybersecurity stocks into freefall. The market just got a live demonstration of Phase 2 disruption.
- **Trump's 15% global tariff officially took effect at 12:01am.** But the customs notice shows the rate is 10%, not 15%. The White House is "working on a formal order" to raise to 15% per Bloomberg. Market confusion about the actual rate is itself the story — the tariff regime is becoming harder to model, not easier.
- **EU Parliament trade committee paused ratification of the US-EU trade deal.** Japan scrambling to protect its $550B investment pledge terms. India-US trade talks on hold. South Korea reviewing. The post-SCOTUS tariff chaos is cascading through every major trade relationship simultaneously.
- **Home Depot beat: $2.72 EPS vs $2.54 est, revenue $38.2B vs $38.1B.** Comp sales trends positive. The consumer isn't dead despite 3.0% core PCE. Housing adjacent names providing a floor.
- **State of the Union tonight at 9pm ET.** Trump faces: SCOTUS defeat, DHS shutdown (Day 10), Iran deadline, and 60% disapproval. 15+ Democratic lawmakers boycotting. Virginia Gov. Spanberger delivering Democratic response. The speech is theater — policy signals on tariffs, Iran, and the shutdown are what matters.

## Crypto
- **BTC broke $65K support, touching $62,858** before bouncing to ~$63K. Down 50% from October ATH. The psychological $60K level is the next test. If it breaks, the 200W MA at ~$42K becomes the conversation.
- **Fear & Greed at 8 — only the third time in index history below 10.** The other two: FTX collapse (June 2022) and COVID crash (March 2020). Both were generational buying opportunities. The pattern recognition is there but the macro backdrop is different — this isn't a crypto-specific event, it's crypto absorbing a multi-front macro storm.
- **$468M liquidated in 24 hours.** 137,422 traders wiped. Largest single liquidation: $61.5M BTC position on HTX. Long positioning at 93% of liquidations. Leverage is getting extinguished.
- **BTC ETF outflows: $204M Monday, $3.8B over five weeks.** BlackRock IBIT: -$116M yesterday. IBIT holdings down to 759K BTC from 806K peak (6% drawdown). Fidelity FBTC down to 186K from 213K (12.6%). The institutional tier is selling now too — this wasn't true two weeks ago.
- **SOL at $78, down 6% but ETF inflows persist.** Six consecutive days of SOL ETF inflows last week while BTC/ETH bled. Funding rate deeply negative — heavy short positioning. Contrarian signal if you believe the agent commerce thesis.
- **Strategy's unrealized loss deepening.** 717K BTC at $76K avg. BTC at $63K = ~$9.3B underwater. Every dollar lower from here increases forced selling risk on the convertible structure.

## AI & Tech
- **Anthropic broke IBM.** Claude Code's COBOL modernization tool can map dependencies and document workflows that "would take human analysts months to surface." IBM lost 13.2% — worst day since 2000, $31B in market cap destroyed. IBM's mainframe modernization business is a multi-billion dollar revenue stream. One AI announcement repriced the entire franchise overnight.
- **Anthropic also broke cybersecurity.** Claude Code Security scans code for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes. CrowdStrike -9.9%, Okta -9.2%, SailPoint -9.4%, Cloudflare -8.1%, Zscaler -5.5%. Global X Cybersecurity ETF hit lowest since Nov 2023. The SaaS repricing thesis now has a live case study of exactly how it works.
- **AMD +10% pre-market: Meta signed a $100B+ multi-year GPU deal.** 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs based on custom MI450 architecture. First 1GW ships H2 2026. Meta gets warrants for 160M AMD shares (~10% of company). Zuckerberg: "personal superintelligence." This validates AMD as genuine NVIDIA alternative and confirms AI capex is accelerating, not plateauing.
- **NVIDIA reports tomorrow (Wednesday) after close.** $65.7B revenue consensus (+67% YoY), $1.53 EPS. Goldman expects $67B+. Polymarket: 94.5% probability of beat. The Meta-AMD deal frames the question: is NVIDIA's moat eroding or is the TAM just expanding so fast it doesn't matter?
- **Amex -7.2%, Visa -4.5%, Mastercard -5.8% on Monday.** Research flagging AI-driven job loss risk to payments volume. AppLovin -9.1%, Oracle -4.6%. The blast radius of AI disruption fear is expanding beyond software into financial services.

## Geopolitics
- **El Mencho killed.** Mexican military, with US intelligence support, killed Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes — leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and one of the world's most wanted drug lords. $15M US bounty. CJNG retaliated immediately: buses torched, roadblocks in Jalisco, Michoacán, Tamaulipas. 25 National Guard members killed. State Dept: shelter in place. Airlines canceling flights to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara.
- **Iran-US nuclear talks Thursday in Geneva — third round.** Iran's Pezeshkian: "encouraging signals" but "prepared for any scenario." Iran ruling out interim deal — wants comprehensive sanctions relief + nuclear preservation. Araghchi: "The US side has not asked for zero enrichment" — contradicts US public stance. Anti-government protests resuming in Tehran universities. Oil at $72 pricing cautious optimism.
- **DHS shutdown Day 10.** FEMA disaster relief fund at $9.6B, down from $30B. Global Entry suspended. No deal expected before tonight's SOTU. Mullin predicts resolution after the address. TSA workers miss first full paycheck March 14. Congress back from recess today.
- **Northeast blizzard grounding flights.** Heavy snow and high winds led to thousands of cancellations. Airlines monitoring first-quarter guidance impact. Delta, United most exposed.

## Deep Read / Listen
**🎧 Anthropic — "Claude Code for COBOL Modernization" and Code Modernization Playbook.** Read the actual announcement that sent IBM down 13%. Understand what Claude can and can't do with legacy codebases. The market reaction was emotional — the capability is real but the timeline to displace IBM's install base is years, not quarters. Knowing the difference is edge. *(~20 min read)*

**📖 Bloomberg Opinion — "Trump Has 3 Military Options for Iran."** Maps the strike scenarios before Thursday's talks. Limited strikes on military installations (most likely), broader nuclear site campaign (escalatory), or Hormuz blockade response (catastrophic for oil). If you're going to have a view on oil this week, understand the option set. *(~10 min read)*

**🎧 Odd Lots — "What AMD's Meta Deal Means for the GPU Duopoly."** Breaking down the $100B deal structure, the warrant mechanics, and what 6GW of AMD GPUs means for NVIDIA's competitive position ahead of tomorrow's earnings. The bull case: TAM expanding. The bear case: margin pressure arriving. *(~45 min)*

## Inner Game

*"The most fundamental aggression to ourselves, the most fundamental harm we can do to ourselves, is to remain ignorant by not having the courage and the respect to look at ourselves honestly and gently."*
— Pema Chödrön

You probably have a running internal monologue right now about all the things you should be doing, haven't done, or aren't doing well enough. That voice sounds like productivity. It's actually avoidance — a way to stay busy judging yourself so you never have to sit still and actually feel what's underneath.

Pema's pointing at something simple: looking at yourself honestly doesn't mean looking at yourself harshly. Honesty without gentleness is just another form of aggression. And most high-performers default to the aggressive version because it feels like discipline. It's not. It's a habit that keeps you running from yourself while pretending you're running toward something.

**Today's action:** Set a timer for 5 minutes. Sit somewhere quiet. No phone, no music, no podcast. Just breathe and notice what comes up without trying to fix it, optimize it, or turn it into a to-do item. The practice isn't about clearing your mind — it's about meeting it honestly. That's the hardest thing most ambitious people never do.

# ▸ THE TAKE

### Anthropic Just Showed You What Phase 2 Looks Like

For months, "AI will disrupt software" was an abstract thesis. Monday it became a case study. One company. Two announcements. $31B in IBM market cap destroyed. Cybersecurity ETF at multi-year lows. Payments stocks cratering on research notes. The speed is the lesson.

**What actually happened.** Anthropic announced that Claude Code can automate COBOL exploration and modernization — mapping dependencies across thousands of lines of legacy code in hours instead of months. Separately, Claude Code Security can scan code for vulnerabilities. Neither announcement was a product launch. They were capability demonstrations. The market repriced IBM and cybersecurity on the *possibility*, not the reality.

**Why this matters structurally.** IBM's mainframe modernization business is worth billions annually. The value proposition has always been: COBOL is so complex that only IBM's consultants and tools can navigate it safely. When an AI model can map those dependencies, the complexity premium collapses. It doesn't matter if Claude replaces IBM today — what matters is that the market now believes it *could*, and that changes the multiple.

**The same logic applies to cybersecurity.** CrowdStrike, Okta, Zscaler — the thesis is that security requires specialized human expertise layered on specialized software. An AI that scans code for vulnerabilities and suggests fixes doesn't eliminate that need, but it compresses the value of the human layer. Fewer analysts needed per endpoint. Lower willingness to pay premium prices.

**The AMD-Meta deal is the counterpoint.** While AI disrupts downstream software, the upstream infrastructure story is accelerating. $100B+ in GPU commitments. 6 gigawatts of compute. Warrants for 10% of AMD's equity. This isn't capex fatigue — this is the biggest hardware deal in computing history. The SaaS Disruption Sorting Framework applies: if your business is building the infrastructure AI runs on, you're being pulled forward. If your business is doing work AI can do, you're being repriced.

**What the market isn't processing yet:** The velocity. IBM went from "safe industrial dividend stock" to "existentially threatened" in one trading session. Cybersecurity went from "upstream of AI, therefore protected" to "vulnerable to AI, therefore repriced" on one demo. The framework error is treating Phase 2 as gradual. It's not. It's punctuated — quiet for months, then sudden on a single catalyst.

**The honest framework:** Anthropic's capabilities are real. The IBM repricing is partly emotional. The actual business impact plays out over years, not weeks. But the market is forward-looking, and what it saw Monday is that the cost of COBOL modernization and basic security scanning is heading toward zero. The companies that depend on those costs staying high just lost their floor.

# ▸ THE BIG STORIES
*The macro trends that matter through the daily noise. Updated when news moves the needle. Silent when it doesn't.*

### 1. Iran — Deal or War, Thursday Is the Test
**Current state:** Third round of Geneva talks confirmed for Thursday. Iran bringing comprehensive proposal — rules out interim deal. US military buildup remains largest since 2003.
**Today's update:** Iran's messaging sharpened: Araghchi claims the US "has not asked for zero enrichment," contradicting the administration's public stance. If true, the gap between sides is narrower than headlines suggest. Anti-government protests at five Tehran universities add domestic pressure. Oil at $72 pricing cautious optimism. If Thursday produces a framework, Brent drops to $65-68. If talks collapse, Trump's deadline activates the military option within days.

### 2. SaaS Repricing — Phase 2 Goes Live
**Current state:** Software ETFs down 17-23% YTD. $1T+ wiped. The sell-off was indiscriminate — now it has a face.
**Today's update:** Anthropic's Monday announcements gave the SaaS repricing thesis its first real-world catalyst. IBM -13% on COBOL modernization. CrowdStrike -9.9%, Okta -9.2% on security automation. Amex -7.2%, Visa -4.5% on payments disruption research. The market now has a template for how Phase 2 works: AI company announces capability → market reprices incumbents overnight. This changes the risk premium for every SaaS and services company. Expect more Anthropic-style catalysts as AI capabilities expand.

### 3. Crypto Bear Market — $60K Test
**Current state:** BTC ~$63K, down 50% from ATH. Fear & Greed at 8 — FTX/COVID territory. ETF outflows $3.8B in five weeks.
**Today's update:** BTC broke below $65K, touching $62,858. This is the first time below $63K since September 2024. The $60K psychological level is the next test. $468M liquidated in 24h. BlackRock IBIT now actively selling — $116M outflow yesterday. This is new: the institutional tier was holding steady until this week. Strategy's unrealized loss at ~$9.3B. If BTC breaks $60K, the $50K conversation starts, and Strategy's forced selling risk enters the pricing.

### 4. Gold Regime Change — Safe Haven Bid Intensifying
**Current state:** Gold $5,133. Silver $88. Goldman $5,400 year-end target. Gold/DXY decoupling sustained.
**Today's update:** Gold holding gains as every macro risk channel feeds the bid: tariff confusion, Iran risk, crypto contagion, equity volatility. Silver near all-time highs at $88 (nominal ATH was $121 in January). The gold + silver trade is attracting capital from both the safety bid and the industrial demand thesis. When equities, crypto, and bonds are all uncertain, gold is the last asset standing.

### 5. AI Capex Cycle — AMD Validates the Spending Wave
**Current state:** $660-690B across hyperscalers in 2026. NVIDIA reports tomorrow.
**Today's update:** The AMD-Meta $100B+ deal is the biggest single validation of AI infrastructure spending since NVIDIA's Blackwell launch. 6GW of AMD GPUs. Custom MI450 chips. Meta gets warrants for 10% of AMD. This confirms: (1) AI capex is accelerating, not plateauing, (2) AMD is a real NVIDIA alternative at scale, (3) the TAM for AI chips is expanding faster than any single company can serve. Tomorrow's NVIDIA earnings now frame as: is the pie growing fast enough that both win?

### 6. Mexico — El Mencho Killing Triggers Cartel War
**Current state (NEW):** Mexican military killed CJNG leader El Mencho with US intelligence support. $15M bounty. Immediate cartel retaliation: 25 National Guard killed, buses torched, roadblocks across multiple states. Airlines canceling Mexico flights. US citizens told to shelter in place.
**Today's update:** Story added. The geopolitical dimension: Trump has pressured Mexico on cartels for months. This operation — with US intelligence — is a success for that pressure campaign. But the vacuum left by El Mencho's death could fragment CJNG and intensify violence. Supply chain risk: Mexico is the US's largest trading partner. Violence disrupting air freight, trucking, and ports is a near-term economic concern.

### 7. DHS Shutdown / Government Dysfunction
**Current state:** Day 10. FEMA disaster relief at $9.6B (down from $30B). Global Entry suspended. Congress returns from recess today.
**Today's update:** Shutdown is now the direct backdrop for tonight's SOTU. Trump plans to urge Democrats to end it during the speech. Mullin predicts resolution after the address. If it extends to March 14, TSA workers miss their first full paycheck and the public impact escalates. The DHS shutdown + tariff confusion + Iran talks are all converging this week — the political system is operating at capacity.

### 8. Tariff Regime — Confusion Phase
**Current state:** Trump announced 15% but customs implemented 10%. 150-day clock running. EU, Japan, India, South Korea all reassessing.
**Today's update:** The gap between the president's announcement (15%) and the actual implementation (10%) creates a new layer of uncertainty. The White House is "working on a formal order" to raise to 15%. Until that order is signed, importers face ambiguous rates. This is worse than clarity at either level — businesses can't model costs when the rate is officially indeterminate. EU froze trade deal ratification.

*Remaining Big Stories — no change today: The Fed's Impossible Position (#5), Humanoid Robotics (#8), Crypto Regulatory Clarity (#9), India Energy Realignment (#10), Political Violence Trend (#11), US-China Tech Decoupling (#12), Nuclear Renaissance (#13), Strategy BTC Treasury Risk (#14 — updated in Crypto Bear Market above), Silver Supply Deficit (#15), AI Model Architecture Shift (#16), Japan Monetary Policy (#17), European Defense Spending (#18), US Fiscal Trajectory (#19), Global Dollar System (#20).*

# ▸ TOMORROW'S HEADLINES
*What the market will be talking about in 12-18 months.*

### Phase 3: Professional Services After SaaS
**New evidence today:** IBM losing 13% on an AI capability demo is the template. If Claude can map COBOL dependencies, it can map consulting project dependencies. If it can scan code for security vulnerabilities, it can scan contracts for legal risks. Accenture (-3.5%) and Cognizant (-2.8%) fell in sympathy. The Phase 3 catalyst — a Fortune 500 publicly replacing a consulting engagement with agents — just moved from "12-18 months" to "possible this year."

### AI-Native vs AI-Augmented Incumbents
**New evidence today:** AMD's Meta deal shows how AI-native partnerships work: custom silicon, equity alignment, gigawatt-scale commitments. IBM's crash shows how AI-augmented incumbents get disrupted: bolt-on services built on human complexity premiums that AI erodes. The gap between these two categories widened materially in a single trading session.

*Full reference list (20 items) unchanged — see below.*

# ▸ THE WATCHLIST
*Regime-changing 2-10x opportunities. Small bets, big asymmetry. Most will be wrong.*

**ETN — Software company disguised as an industrial**
~$380. Data center orders +200%. Electrical backlog $15.3B.
**The insight:** Every data center needs recurring power management software that isn't broken out. Re-rates from "industrial 29x" to "hybrid 35x+." If the AI-energy convergence plays out, 3-5x over 3-5 years.
**Upside:** Software reclassification at 35x = $560 (47%). AI energy narrative = $700+ (80%+).
**Downside:** Buildout slows, range-bound (~10%).
**Validates:** Software-attached revenue reported. Data center >25% of revenue.
**Rejects:** Margins flat. No software breakout through 2027.
*Feb 24 note:* AMD-Meta deal at 6GW validates that data center buildout is accelerating. Every GW of AMD GPUs needs ETN's power management infrastructure. The picks-and-shovels thesis strengthens.

**SOL — Agent payment rails**
~$78, down 77% from ATH.
**The insight:** AI agents need micropayments at machine speed. Banks can't clear $0.001. Solana can. Leading all chains in payment volume during a bear. Staking ETFs creating institutional floor. Nobody models machine transaction volume.
**Upside:** Agent commerce + cycle recovery = $200-300 (2.5-3.5x). Machine commerce real = $500+ (6x).
**Downside:** Agents use Stripe. SOL to $40 (~50%).
**Validates:** Agent tx volume on Solana. x402 >$1B cumulative. ETF inflow trend persists.
**Rejects:** Agent commerce centralizes. Reliability issues.
*Feb 24 note:* SOL at $78 with deeply negative funding rates. Six consecutive days of ETF inflows last week while BTC/ETH hemorrhaged. The short positioning is extreme — if there's a squeeze, it comes from here. The price is 77% below ATH. If the agent commerce thesis is right, this is the entry. If wrong, position sizing limits the damage.

**Harmonic Drive (6324.T) — Humanoid picks-and-shovels**
~¥3,800.
**The insight:** Every humanoid platform needs the same precision actuators. Near-monopoly on strain wave gears, minimal Western coverage. Wins regardless of which platform wins.
**Upside:** 500K units/yr by 2028, 20-40 actuators each. Revenue triples = 3x+.
**Downside:** Timeline slips. Chinese competitors. 30-50% down.
**Validates:** Tesla ships externally. Humanoid OEM backlog growth.
**Rejects:** Production <10K in 2026.

**Gulf Sovereign AI — Thematic, watching for vehicle**
**The insight:** Gulf running oil playbook with compute. Cheapest energy, 3.5B people need AI outside US/China. 95% of AI allocation is US tech. UAE at 14x vs S&P 21x.
**Upside:** G42 IPO creates investable category. 30%+ broad.
**Downside:** Captured by hyperscalers. 10-15%.
**Validates:** G42 IPO. Sovereign AI deals bypass AWS/Azure.
**Rejects:** Hyperscalers go direct. No differentiated tech.

# ▸ DISCOVERY

**Novo Nordisk's CagriSema Trial Failure Reveals the GLP-1 Power Law** — Novo's next-gen obesity drug hit 23% weight loss vs tirzepatide's 25.5% in head-to-head REDEFINE 4 trial. Stock down 16%. The interesting part isn't the miss — it's the market's reaction. A 2.5 percentage point difference in weight loss produced a $60B market cap swing between Novo and Lilly. In winner-take-most markets, "almost as good" means losing everything. The same dynamic plays out in AI models, social networks, and payment rails. Slight performance edges don't produce slight market share differences — they produce exponential ones. This is the power law at work in pharma, and it maps directly to why NVIDIA at 75% GPU share matters more than AMD at 25%.

---

# ▸ WORLDVIEW UPDATES

**Proposed changes based on today's brief:**

1. **New Big Story: Mexico — El Mencho Killing / Cartel Destabilization.** The killing of CJNG's leader with US intelligence support, followed by immediate cartel retaliation, is a significant geopolitical event. Supply chain risk to US-Mexico trade, airline disruption, shelter-in-place orders for US citizens. Connects to the broader Trump border/cartel pressure campaign. Worth tracking as a Big Story (#22).

2. **Big Story #2 (SaaS Repricing) upgraded to "Phase 2 Goes Live."** Anthropic's IBM and cybersecurity disruption gave the thesis its first real-world catalyst. The market now has a template for how Phase 2 plays out. The repricing is no longer abstract.

3. **Crypto Bear Market: BTC broke $65K.** Update current state to ~$63K. 50% from ATH. Fear & Greed at 8. Institutional tier (BlackRock IBIT) now actively selling — a regime shift from prior weeks. Strategy unrealized loss at ~$9.3B.

4. **AI Capex Cycle: AMD-Meta $100B deal.** Validates spending acceleration. AMD is a real NVIDIA alternative at scale. Update after NVIDIA earnings tomorrow.

5. **Thesis #1 (SaaS repricing is structural) — confidence reinforced.** IBM -13% and cybersecurity crash on capability demonstrations is exactly the mechanism the thesis predicted. No confidence level change yet (already High), but the evidence quality improved materially.

6. **Framework addition: "AI Disruption Velocity."** Phase 2 disruption is punctuated, not gradual. Quiet for months, then sudden on a single catalyst. IBM went from "safe" to "existentially threatened" in one session. The framework: don't model AI disruption as linear cost compression — model it as capability demonstrations that trigger overnight repricing. Position before the demo, not after.

7. **Watchlist updates:** SOL at $78 with deeply negative funding and persistent ETF inflows is the most asymmetric setup since it was added. ETN strengthened by AMD-Meta validation. No additions or removals.

*Source check: Any sources to add or remove? Any new voices, dashboards, or feeds that surfaced today that should join the list?*
