# Newsletter Strategy

**AI-assisted, your voice, philosophically grounded.**

---

## Format

**Weekly newsletter:**
1. Your intro (your voice, philosophy)
2. Model (distilled, concise)
3. Best highlight (from your Readwise)
4. CTA (link to full model)

**Length**: ~300 words. People are busy.

## Your Voice

**Where**: Intro only. Sets the philosophical foundation.

**Themes** (customize in script):
- Information is free, truth is timeless
- Curated learning > infinite content
- Mental models = pattern recognition
- Better thinking = better life
- Ideas that matter

**Tone**: Direct, thoughtful, grounded.

## AI Assistance

**What AI does**:
- Distills model to essentials
- Extracts best highlight
- Keeps it concise

**What you do**:
- Set philosophical themes
- Review/edit intro
- Ensure quality

**Not slop**: Your curation + your voice + AI distillation = quality.

---

## Process

1. Run script: `npm run newsletter`
2. Review output
3. Edit intro if needed
4. Send

**Time**: 5-10 minutes per week.

## Customization

Edit `scripts/generate-newsletter.js`:
- `YOUR_THEMES` array (your philosophy)
- `generateIntro()` function (your voice)
- Distillation logic (what to include)

---

**That's it. Simple, effective, yours.**
