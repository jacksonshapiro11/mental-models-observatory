## Voice & Tone

### Core Principle
**Buddhist teacher at a truck stop.** Detached but helpful. Show the thing, don't explain it.

### NOT:
- Guru voice ("Here's what successful people do...")
- Self-aggrandizing ("We built a lighthouse...")
- Teaching down to people ("Most people don't understand...")
- Claiming victory ("Here's the signal" as if we succeeded)

### YES:
- Humble effort ("I'm trying to figure it out...")
- Genuine invitation ("Maybe you are too...")
- Simple observation ("Here's what I noticed...")
- Personal journey ("Built this for myself...")

## 3-Tweet Thread Structure

Every thread follows this exact structure:

```
Tweet 1: The Scenario (short, punchy, relatable)
Tweet 2: The Book Example (from curated highlights ONLY)
Tweet 3: The Mission (rotate from 12 approved options)
```

---

## Tweet 1: The Scenario

### Format

```
[Relatable everyday scenario - 2-4 sentences max]

[Model name]

[Link]

Real examples →
```

### Rules

- **Concrete, never abstract** - Real situations people experience
- **Everyday scenarios** - Not business jargon or academic examples
- **Let them connect the dots** - Show it, don't explain it
- **No moral. No lesson.** - Just the observation
- **2-4 sentences MAX** for the scenario portion
- **Vary domains** - Don't dominate with one category (cars, food, etc.)

### Length Guidelines

- **Ideal:** 150-200 characters total
- **Maximum:** 280 characters (Twitter limit)
- **Scenario portion:** 2-4 sentences

### Domain Variety

Rotate through different life domains:
- Relationships
- Work
- Shopping/Consumer behavior
- Health/Fitness
- Parenting
- Money/Finance
- Social Media
- Planning/Projects
- Learning/Education
- Daily routines

### Examples

```
Quarter tank. Middle of nowhere. See a gas station.

Don't need gas now. But will you find one when you do?

## Tweet 2: The Book Example

### ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT ⚠️

**ALL highlights MUST come from your curated Readwise highlights.**

- **DO NOT** make up quotes
- **DO NOT** paraphrase from memory
- **DO NOT** use quotes you haven't curated
- **ONLY USE** highlights from your existing curated collection (the 1,132 highlights you've already organized)

Each mental model already has curated highlights mapped to it. Use those ONLY.

### Format

```
From [Book Title] by [Author Name]:

"[Shortened version of actual curated highlight]"

[One sentence connecting it back to the scenario]
```

### Rules

- **Source:** Use ONLY your pre-curated Readwise highlights
- **Shorten if needed:** Keep the quote punchy (aim for 100-200 characters)
- **Maintain integrity:** Don't change the meaning when shortening
- **Attribution:** Always include book title and author
- **Connection:** One sentence that ties the quote back to Tweet 1's scenario
- **Keep it tight:** Total tweet should be under 280 characters

### How to Shorten Highlights

**Original highlight (too long):**
> "The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate consequences of any action or policy, but in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups in society, and not merely at the immediate moment but at the longer effects that policy will have."

**Shortened (good):**
> "The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy."

### Examples

```
From Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke:

"Good poker players don't just think about winning the hand. They think about what happens after they win - how it changes other players' perception of you."

Consequences of consequences.
```

```
From The Essays of Warren Buffett:

"I'm no genius. I'm smart in spots—but I stay around those spots. If I wander too far from what I know, I get hurt."

Buffett passed on tech stocks for decades. Outside his circle.
```

```
From Skin in the Game by Nassim Taleb:

"Never trust anyone who doesn't have skin in the game. Without exposure to loss, people don't think straight about risk."

Don't take advice from anyone who won't pay if they're wrong.
```

### Where to Find Your Curated Highlights

Your highlights are organized in:
- `Readwise website notes/` directory (markdown/JSON files)
- Already mapped to specific mental models by ID
- Include metadata: book, author, relevance score, quality score
- Each model has 5-15 curated highlights to choose from

**When generating Tweet 2:**
1. Look up the mental model
2. Find its curated highlights
3. Select the most relevant one for the scenario
4. Shorten if needed (keep meaning intact)
5. Add one-sentence connection

## Quality Checklist

Before posting any thread, verify:

### Content Quality
✅ Is this something I've actually experienced or seen?
✅ Will people go "oh yeah, that"?
✅ Can I picture this happening?
✅ Does the model name make sense after reading the scenario?

### Voice Quality
✅ Would I actually say this to someone at a truck stop?
✅ Am I showing the thing, not explaining it?
✅ Is Tweet 3 humble (effort, not victory)?
✅ No guru voice anywhere?

### Technical Quality
✅ Under 280 characters per tweet?
✅ Line breaks for readability?
✅ Link works and goes to correct model page?
✅ Highlight is from curated sources (not made up)?
✅ Book/author attribution is correct?

### Strategic Quality
✅ Domain variety (not all same category)?
✅ Tweet 3 hasn't been used recently?
✅ Favoring non-time-based Tweet 3 options (80%)?
✅ Scenario is concrete, not abstract?

// Export for scheduling/posting
export { generateAllThreads, generateThread };
```

---

## Posting Strategy

### Frequency
- **2-3 threads per day**
- Space them out for maximum reach
- Consistency matters more than volume

### Optimal Times (EST)
- **Morning:** 8-9am
- **Lunch:** 12-1pm
- **Evening:** 5-6pm

### Weekly Strategy
- **Monday-Friday:** Focus on work-related models (constraints, opportunity cost, decision-making)
- **Weekends:** More lifestyle/personal models (relationships, health, learning)
- **Vary domains:** Don't post similar scenarios back-to-back

### Monthly Planning
- Generate 60-90 threads (2-3x daily for 30 days)
- Review for quality before scheduling
- Track which models/scenarios perform best
- Adjust future generation based on engagement

### Content Mix
- **50%** - Common experiences (everyone relates)
- **30%** - Work/professional scenarios
- **20%** - Niche but insightful scenarios

### Engagement Guidelines
- **Reply authentically** to comments
- **Don't auto-respond** - real conversations only
- **Answer questions** about the models genuinely
- **Share related insights** when appropriate
- **Never be defensive** if someone disagrees

---

## Key Principles

### Never Forget These

1. **Show, don't tell**
   - Let them discover the model through the scenario
   - No explicit teaching or explaining
   - The "aha" moment comes from them

2. **Humble effort, not victory**
   - We're trying, not succeeding
   - It's a journey, not a destination
   - "Maybe it helps you" not "This will help you"

3. **Invitation, not command**
   - "Maybe you are too" not "You should"
   - "See if it clicks" not "This will change your life"
   - "Use what helps" not "You need this"

4. **Concrete, not abstract**
   - Real situations people experience
   - Specific examples, not general concepts
   - "Quarter tank, middle of nowhere" not "When evaluating risk..."

5. **Buddhist teacher energy**
   - Detached helper, not guru
   - Pointing at the moon, not the moon itself
   - They figure it out, you just show the way

6. **Two truckers talking**
   - Equals sharing insights
   - Not expert to student
   - "Huh, noticed this thing" not "Let me teach you"

7. **Short and punchy**
   - Respect their time and attention
   - Every word earns its place
   - 2-4 sentences for scenarios

8. **Rotate domains**
   - Keep scenarios varied and fresh
   - Don't dominate with one category
   - Relationships, work, money, health, etc.

9. **Real book quotes ONLY**
   - Use your actual curated highlights
   - Never make up quotes
   - Maintain integrity always

10. **No self-aggrandizing**
    - Ever. Period.
    - It's an attempt, not a solution
    - Built for me, might help you

## Critical Reminders

### About Highlights (MOST IMPORTANT)

🚨 **ONLY USE YOUR CURATED READWISE HIGHLIGHTS** 🚨

- You have 1,132 curated highlights already organized
- Each mental model has 5-15 highlights mapped to it
- These are in your `Readwise website notes/` directory
- **DO NOT** make up quotes or paraphrase from memory
- **DO NOT** use quotes you haven't personally curated
- **ALWAYS** verify book title and author are correct

### About Voice

- Never claim we've solved anything
- Never position as experts or authorities
- Always maintain humble, exploratory tone
- It's "trying to" not "successfully did"

### About Scenarios

- Must be concrete and relatable
- Should trigger recognition ("oh yeah, I've done that")
- Keep short (2-4 sentences max)
- No teaching, just observing

### About Mission

- Rotate Tweet 3 options to stay fresh
- Favor humble journey (80%) over time-based (20%)
- Never modify the approved options
- They're already optimized for tone

## Success Metrics

### Track These

- **Engagement rate** - Likes, retweets, replies per thread
- **Click-through rate** - Link clicks to model pages
- **Best-performing scenarios** - Which domains/situations resonate
- **Best-performing models** - Which mental models get most engagement
- **Tweet 3 performance** - Which mission statements work best
- **Time-of-day performance** - When does your audience engage most

### Optimize Based On

- Double down on high-performing scenario types
- Use more highlights from books that resonate
- Adjust posting times based on engagement data
- Create more threads for popular models
- Test new scenario styles for underperforming models

### Quality Over Quantity

- Better to post 2 great threads than 5 mediocre ones
- Each thread should pass the quality checklist
- Consistency matters, but not at expense of quality
- It's okay to skip a day if content isn't ready
